        "``.... and that concludes your training. Welcome to Surely Insurance, and before you partner off to start at your desks are there any questions. Anything we didn't cover in the training? Yes Philip what would you like to know?\" \n\n\"Our most profitable customer, oh that is a good one. And not a question I have been asked before. I imagine most of you think it was Jeanne Calment, but alas no. Lets have a look shall we.\" \n\n\"Peter can you put our customer database on screen for us.\" \n\n\"Thank you\" \n\n\"Now build a custom search. Start by adjusting all payments for inflation. And why do we do that?\" \n\n\"That's right Simone, it allows us to see the absolute value of their insurance payments in today's money. We want to be duly diligent in all our work, even answering each others questions. Especially as you have managed to pique my interest as well.\" \n\n\"The next step will be to sum all of the payments the customer has made. Again what must we bear in mind?\" \n\n\"Quite right Maggie, that we ensure we sort by individual customer not joint or family policies. These are how much more profitable for us?\" \n\n\"Fantastic, and where to we derive this extra 20 % per person from?\" \n\n\"Oh splendid John, as he says intangible benefits. Something we expect you to do rather well on selling. Remember'The only way to be sure, it be be Surely Insured', and that piece of mind comes at a premium.\" \n\n\"So the final step is to output that data to a simple table. Lets only look for the top 100, saves a little computing time. And voila, thank you Peter.\" \n\n\"You can see here our most profitable customer is a Dorothy Walpole. She paid out over \u00a310.5 million in life insurance premiums. One of our first ever customers. You might be surprised that we digitised his records, but we like to remember where we came from.\" \n\n\"The green mark next to the accounts? Well we did cover this earlier. Can anyone tell Mr. Shepton what that means?\" \n\n\"Oh you know that it indicates an active account.\"",
        "I remember well how it was before. It used to be easy: You'd leave your home, move away from the area you'd known your entire life, away from your parents. You'd build a home of your own. Quiet. Right down on the water\u2014the land was plentiful then. Eventually you'd find a companion. One who would share your home, bear your children. And the cycle would start again. \n\nOccasionally something would happen that would disrupt things. A flood would sweep away homes, sometimes yours. There would be a fire and the available wood would dwindle and you'd have to move your family. Ones that you knew, neighbors, would go out and not come back, just disappear one day. Sometimes you'd hear the loud alarm from your neighbors, a bolt from the blue that warned of some nearing danger. But for the most part, life was simple, and luck was in our favor. \n\nThen it changed. Then there was the fear and uncertainty. They came. \n\nI remember well the first time I felt the fear. I was out gathering for my family when I came across the body. It was one of my neighbors, I'd recently had a loud fight with him, keeping him away from my wife whom he sought to draw away from me. I'd have killed him if he touched her, but he didn't deserve this. He lay there, still and dead, his skin ripped from his body. I did my best to process what was before me, but I hardly had time before I heard a scream in a familiar voice. I ran to my daughter, caught in some manner of devious trap, begging for my help. And I saw them. Giants, two of them, casually walking in their foreign gait toward my poor, terrified daughter, and I could do nothing. One of them pointed at me and said something in an unintelligible language, and the other raised a thing to point at me.",
        "Mike couldn't listen anymore to the overwhelming evidence presented before the judge, so he tuned them out and thought about the true events of that night. It wasn't even six, spaghetti noodles were boiling on the stove, and he was going through bills at the kitchen table. It was summer, so the sky was only just beginning to darken. His daughter, Cathy was outside. He called through the window for her and after the second call with no reply, he was dashing out of the house in a panic. \n\nCathy was curled into a ball on the side of the road, dark red spots pooled on the tar covered skid marks that drew his eye to the'79 Cutlass in the ditch. No driver in sight. Mike's mind had gone into overdrive as he ran to his daughter's side, trying to assess the damage \u201c Cat, Little Cat, \u201d he had whined, turning his daughter over, \u201c Cathy? Can you hear me? \u201d \n\nSlowly one green eye opened. She looked at me and smiled. Mike's stomach dropped in relief, she was not dead. But there was so much blood! Mike's stomach flipped and dropped again, tightly clenched to her body was our cat Pancakes. Pancakes lay limp and broken in her arms. The blood belonged to the cat. Cathy must have saw what happened and ran over to our cat, trying to protect him even though he was already dead. \n\nMike then took the blood soaked cat away from the girl and told her to go back up to the house and turn the stove off before the water boiled over. Meanwhile he got the shovel out from the garage and walked to the public trail entrance near the empty'79 Cutlass. \n\nHe hadn't thought it was odd that whoever ran over Pancakes just left his car and vanished, because he was busy digging a hole in the little patch of woods.",
        "Mr. Kim stood as his eyes widened. He realized how terrible he was, and his father, and his grandfather. They were the most hated and feared people in the world, but were also the butt of scores of jokes, and a laughing stock of a nation. Mr. Kim retired to the corner of the cave, and began weeping. \n\nHe couldn't wish for death, that's against the rules. If he wished his grandfather wasn't born, then he couldn't exist to find the genie, and a time travel paradox would be created. No, he couldn't fix the past, but he also couldn't pretend it never happened. He approached the genie, wiping tears away from his eyes. \n\n\"I wish the people of North Korea had the strength and knowledge to rebel against the government.\" \n\nThe genie waved his hand, and the countryside began to rumble with the calls of revolution. Kim peaked outside the cave, as the countryside was rampant with fires and makeshift weaponry. \n\n\"You know,\" began the genie, \"They're going to gut you like a pig.\" \n\n\"No they won't.\" \n\n\"How do you figure?\" \n\nMr. Kim tented his fingers. \"Although I have realized my crimes, intelligence is no indicator of morality. Isn't that right?\" \n\n\"I don't care about morality, I'm a genie. People always ask for immoral things!\" \n\n\"I figured. So, I wish I was an emaciated Korean woman.\" \n\nThe genie looked defeated, but waved his hand towards the evil dictator. \n\n\"What are you going to do now?\" The genie curiously asked. \n\n\"I'm going to take revenge on those who convinced me I was benevolent.\" \n\nWith that, the world's most insane dictator left the cave into the fiery meadows below, and joined a mob of angry, starving folks, heading for Pyongyang.",
        "I loved the feeling of the cool night air from my open window. I was leaning against my windowsill, staring up at the stars, softly singing Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star. I focused my attention on a certain star, the biggest one that I could see. But as I repeated the song, staring at the star, I realized it was.... growing *bigger*. Bigger and bigger, until its light illuminated my entire room. And then the light rapidly dimmed, dulling out to a smooth glow, leaving a humanlike figure in its wake. The figure stood, or floated rather, directly outside my window, and then a gentle voice rang out: \"Hello? Where am I?\" \n\nI didn't know what to say, how to react, or whether this was a dream. The words had left my mouth nearly before I realized it: \"This is my room.\" \n\n\"It's nice,\" the voice murmured. The figure edged closer, and its features sharpened until I could make out what it was: a girl. She looked like an ordinary girl, about my age, except she was kind of blueish gray, and glowing. I was hardly confused, just mesmerized. I decided to just speak, discover who this was. Maybe I could make a new friend. \"Who are you? What's your name? How did-\" \n\nMy questions were interrupted by the girl's small giggle. \"You ask a lot of questions. My name's Ella, and I'm an angel. I didn't wan na stay up in the sky,'cause it was boring, so I came down here. What's your name?\" \n\n\"I'm Devon, and I'm seven. I didn't know angels were real, do a lot of angels leave the sky?\" \n\n\"Devon?\" Mom's voice came from the other side of the bedroom door. \"Who are you talking to?\" \n\nI gasped in horror, would Mom like Ella? Would Ella like Mom? I looked to the angel for answers, and she smiled.",
        "Drinking wouldn't help him, but he sat down at the bar in the ballroom all the same. It was busily being prepared by the worker bees who'd been hired to make sure the most joyous and wonderful union about to take place would do so with the utmost perfection. \n\nHis head was pounding. It was pounding harder now than it had when he'd woken up six hours ago, two hours late for Groomsman photo's his best friend had sworn would not take place without him. \n\n\"Fucking Gatorade\" he muttered to himself. \n\n\"Only got the regular kind, Jack\" said an approaching bar tender. David hated bartender talk. \n\nHe didn't look at him but just said \"Whiskey, double, clean\". \n\nThe bartender nodded and went to fix his drink. It was ready quite before David had expected it to be. Where it was usually a fork in the road between a path of drinking and not drinking, David only saw one path with many drinks along the way. \n\nHe'd either numb the pain or it would come slurring out of him at some point. It was up in the air. \n\n\"That'll be 18 buck-aroos, buckaroo\" the bartender said. David looked at him but said nothing. It was supposed to be an open bar. A gift from the grave of the brides father and the bank account that held the trust fund he'd left her. The thought revealed a memory from the night before.... and it stung. \n\n'What kind of idiot sends a 200 dollar wreath to a headstone' he thought himself pathetically. \n\n'The same kind who spends the night watching the Kiera Knightley-Rick from the Walking Dead scenes from Love, Actually on a drunken loop all night long', he answered his thought. \n\nHe sat there sadly and quietly for a moment. He needed a change of subject but the weed he'd smoked before arriving for the photo's in an effort to cover up his hangover was currently back firing on him. Instead of dulling the pain of his headache and the relaxing him, he'd ended up with a smokers head ache swimming in an ocean of tortured thoughts. \n\n'What a poetic mother fucker', he thought.'Shakespeare would shit himself'. \n\nThe bartender was approaching at just the moment the whiskey he'd shot down was affecting him just. No doubt he noticed an empty glass and walked over to refill it. \n\n\"I thought the bar was open....asshole\" he said. Anger swirling inside him.",
        "As the last of the kaiju beast monster's ashes fall to the ground, like black snowflakes on an autumn's night, I take a minute to breathe. In the distance, the sirens screech while above me, the chopper blades rip through the night sky like the demon's heartbeat. \n\n\"Boss, we need to go,\" Boris tells me. \"They're coming.\" \n\nI close my eyes and sigh. Maybe this time when I speak, things will be different. \n\n\"Silence, you imbecile, or I, the great Dr. Demento shall eradicate your spleen with my ray of evil cosmic death.\" Another epic failure in communications. It wasn't my fault. It was *him* -- always *him*. \n\n\"Uh.... sure boss. Sorry,\" Boris says. \"Look, we really need to get out of here. I mean, we had no business being here in the first place.\" \n\nWe had plenty of business being here. An evil monster, the size of a skyscraper, was tearing up the financial district of my city, eating bankers and actuaries like pop tarts. If I didn't stop it, then who would? \n\n\"The cops are only minutes away. Like always, they're going to blame us for all the death and destruction,\" Boris cries out. \n\nMaybe I can reason with the cops this time? Maybe, for once, *he'll* shut up and allow me to talk. \"Let those pigs come. I will crush them like I crush walnuts in between my thighs, for I am Dr. Demento, master of cosmic death, disruptor of wholesome truth, and manipulator of our monochromatic existence.\" \n\nNo, no, no, shut up, just shut up and let me talk. Let the real me talk.... please! \n\nI watch as the first police offer shows up. He gets out of his car and before a word of warning, points his gun straight at my head. He radios in. \"Guys, we have Dr. Demento again. I'll need all the back up I can. Is Ultra Boy available? Someone light the Ultra beacon.\" \n\nI shake my head. Not Ultra Boy again. Over the course of my super-hero career, that imbecile has knocked out four of my teeth and displaced my hip twice. If he'd only taken the opportunity to listen to the real me, violence wouldn't have been necessary. Each and every time, it was always a misunderstanding. I was always doing what's best for the city. \n\nI notice the police officer's hand trembling. His finger is resting on the trigger. There's no need for this. We're both on the same side. Perhaps I can convince him to drop his weapon? I lick my lips, and then try to speak words of reason. \"Communist swine, of subpar intelligence. Don't point your weapons at me, unless you wish to gum food for the rest of your useless existence.\"",
        "The best part of waking up is breakfast. It's better when someone else is making it, but even if I'm begrudgingly making it, the second that bacon hits the pan, the whole world seems to light up. I drop a couple pieces and as soon as the smell hits me, I smile. It's the perfect way to start the morning. The world couldn't possibly be better as I stare out my open kitchen window at the birds playing in the new spring air. I grab a couple eggs out of the fridge and toss them into the pan after dishing out the bacon. The pan crackles a bit, then settles down and I lightly add salt and fresh ground pepper to my eggs. My mouth is watering by the time my meal has finished, and I sit down eagerly. As soon as the egg hits my mouth, I wake up, thrown back into the horrible reality that I find myself in. As I look around the the basement, I can feel the gag in my mouth muffle any words I've might've said, and as I look at the nub that was once my hand, I start to weep.",
        "Here's a cliche for you- love hurts. But no, really. Love is painful. \n\nEspecially when someone you love doesn't love you back. You sit and cry in the shower as it hits you like a ton of bricks that they will never care about you in the way that you want- no need them to. They sit and go about their life as if they didn't do anything to you. As if they can still be in your life even though whenever you see or even think about them, your heart continues to break. It's not like you can tell them you love them because that's not fair to you or them. Admitting that you love them and having them tell you they don't love you back will crush you; having them pity you will crush you. \n\nBut you keep trying to find it. Even though this pain can be so unbearable, you keep going. That first kiss makes it worth it- the awkward, heart racing, whole body tingling mess. The first time they take your hand in theirs and you can't help but smile. When they kiss you on your shoulder in the middle of the night, just to remind you they're there.",
        "Bodies were everywhere, his personal staff, young men surrounded by pools of blood from the bullet wounds, one man even looked like he was burned badly before he died having burn marks all over his arms and neck. There I found him clutching a book with a hole directly between his eyes. I still can not believe he took the satisfaction from us so close! I flipped through the pages of the blood covered book wondering what it was that the scumbag had to cherish before he took his life like a coward. I began to read: \n.... that this is what the world needs? Who are these spies and how are they infiltrating my personal guard? Just yesterday as I was riding back to the capital, I noticed something was off about my driver who had such an interesting metal bracelet hanging on his left wrist. All I could make out were numbers that seemed to glow as if made of light. No sooner did we reach the capital when the driver turned the wheel sharply to send us into the wall preventing the car from careening down into the waters below! Thankfully the wall stopped the vehicle but was clearly damaged. Just as I was regaining my wits, I noticed the vehicle was backing up as if to align itself for another go at the damaged wall of the bridge. I threw open the door as the force from acceleration threw me off balance. I leaped from the car just in time as I rolled forcefully into the bottom of the retaining wall and the car fell crashing and quickly sinking to the bottom of the river.",
        "I moved to Seattle after the war, but didn't stay long. The city was too loud, or I was too jumpy. Probably both. I went north to Bellevue, but that, too, was too much for me. Horns honking, too-loud radios, airplanes flying overhead. One night I went to an Indian casino. It was just rows and rows clanking, singing and flashing slot machines. I couldn't bear it. I went into the bathroom and cried like a baby. The very next day I sold my Honda Accord, bought an old 4Runner and went into the deep blue woods. I can't believe that was six years ago already. \n\nI had a cabin - really just four walls, a roof and a wood stove. The deer were plentiful, and I fished in a nearby stream. For the most part, I was content. \n\nOnce every three months or so, I'd head into town to stock up on essentials. Sometimes, I'd spend the night with Lucy, who I met at Wallmart, of all places. She said she liked the way I smelled, that there was something authentic about it. I got her pregnant. She didn't expect anything of me, which was nice, as I didn't have anything to provide. \n\nWhen the baby was born I went to see it. I was expecting something profound, some kind of bonding moment. But that didn't happen. It was just a baby. Lucy said she thought the baby should see where I live. I didn't say no. I didn't say anything, actually, but something about my expression gave the impression that that was never going to happen, and it never did. \n\nI watched my child grow in three month intervals. He always treated me like a stranger. \n\nOvertime, I went into town less and less. I became more self-sufficient. I learned the seasons. My harvests were more fruitful. I lost track of how long it had been since I'd seen Lucy, and my son. \n\nI went to bed on one clear winter night and dreamed I was back at war. The syncopated popping of automatic gunfire, the screaming, lying in dirt, crawling through a doorway, and finally, safety. \n\nThe next day I went into town. My beard had grown long and matted.",
        "\"Bananas?\" \n\n'Bananas. Lifetime supply.\" \n\n\"Guess I should have woken up sooner, then,\" Dave grumbled. His head hurt. This all felt like a bad dream. \n\nThe last thing Dave could remember was getting into his car to go to work. A regular Tuesday morning in September. 1975. And now here he was, sitting in a hospital bed having awoken from a 40-year coma, apparently the winner of a \"Pass the Potassium\" radio contest right before his accident. His prize? A lifetime supply of bananas. And after learning of Dave's condition, the radio station - not sure of their legal requirement to supply a lifetime supply of anything to a man in a coma - had been sending the hospital a banana each week for the last 40 years. \n\nDave was peeling the latest delivery. \n\n\"What about Lucy?\" Dave asked between bites. Boy was he hungry. \"How is my sister?\" \n\n\"I'm sorry to tell you sir, but she passed away a few years ago. Cancer, I believe. But she became a very successful woman before her passing, founding numerous humanitarian and animal-rights causes. While they have all since wound down or been assumed by other organizations, Lucy did bequeath one to you should you ever awake: the American Penguin Society. It looks after penguins lost off the East coast, before releasing them back into their native habitat.\" \n\n\"So you're telling me I'm responsible for these penguins now?\" Dave asked incredulously. \n\n\"That's correct, sir.\" \n\nPenguins and bananas. What was next? \n\n\"I'd like to be left alone, please.\"",
        "\u201c Why do you kill? \u201d \n\nToby lay on the floor allowing his inner monologue to wander for a moment, as it usually does when the Sun is high in the sky, shining through the gap in the curtains. Why indeed? \n\nWas he taught how to do it? Was it a bad upbringing that drove him to murder? Doubtful. He lived a life of luxury ever since he was brought home. He had affection from his family, and offered it back in spades. No real unhappy moments as far as he could remember. He certainly didn't do it in desperation, as he had all the food, drink, and company anyone could ever hope for. \n\nWas it to protect what was rightfully his? Again, not the right answer. He and his family did not have any major threats. Sure, the occasional accident on the nearby roads could be considered a liability, but it was out of his control. No real enemies, at least none that could be a real danger. Besides, he kept a look out all the time, watching over the neighbors and making sure nothing strange happened. Mrs Jenkins across the road did pass away a few months ago, but that had nothing to do do with him. Probably nothing to do with him. Maybe. \n\nHe shook his foot to stop an itch, caused by the Sun slowly creeping up his leg as he pondered. \n\nThe question remained. Why? What caused him to stalk around, looking for prey? Why did he take innocent victims from their families, brought them home, and pulled their intestines out? The macabre display that his loved ones reviled, but tolerated. \n\nThe thought conjured up his most recent kill. A small body that was difficult to catch, but it was not nimble enough to get away from Toby's finely-honed physique and techniques. He relived the feelings of those few seconds of slaughter. Happiness. Satisfaction. A feeling of release. \n\nThe Sun started to dazzle Toby, warming his face and telling him to get up. \n\nHis memory stirred something inside him. He had a compulsion to do it again.",
        "\"What do you mean'no'?\" the man asked the elderly toy maker on his bench. The older man simply shook his head in response, too caught up in creating his next invention: A wooden toy soldier. He was still putting on the finishing touches, slowly and carefully hand painting the last few coats of color to give it the life it deserved. Though his hands were aged, they had most certainly not lost their touch nor finesse. \n\n\"I said, what do you mean you're not going to make a toy for my son this year? I can pay you as much as you god damn want, you old fart!\" His questions were turning into demands at this point, the wealthy businessman being driven to his knees by a lowly toy maker. He was making himself looking like a fool, but that didn't matter at the moment because the shop was empty aside from the two of them. This didn't include the dolls sitting upon rows and rows of shelves, staring down upon them with their black, beady little eyes. Finally, the old toy maker replied, but if only to get the disturbance to leave his premise. \n\n\"I've told you, your boy doesn't deserve my creations. Every year it's the same. I put in hours upon hours of effort, bucketloads of sweat for your precious son's birthday present. And what do I get in return? Broken pieces and scraps returned to me the very next week. If he doesn't know how to treat his toys with respect, then he's not getting any toys!\" he snapped with ferocious fervor. He coughed a little, his anger having clouded his mind. \"LEAVE!\" he managed to spit out one last time before entering a coughing fit. \n\nThe toy maker abruptly fell to the floor and grasped his throat. He was choking on something and by the shade of purple his face was turning, it was apparent he couldn't breath. His other arm reached for the businessman, pleading for help. Help that never came. The wealthy man simply watched with the cruelest of smiles his lips had ever made. He watched on without remorse as the toy maker's life slowly ebbed away from him.",
        "The old man stared at Jim for what felt like an eternity. Jim could feel the heat of the gaze from those nearly 3/4 century old eyes. The silence was painful and with every tick of the clock, Jim felt his chances of survival grow ever slimmer. When the old man spoke it was with a harsh rasp. \n\n\"You fucked up, Jimbo.\" \n\nJim nodded his head. There was nothing to say, really. He did fuck up. \n\n\"We went over it t'ree times. All you had to do was wait for the guys then drive away when they got inda car.\" \n\nJim nodded his head and made a motion like he was going to respond to the old man's point. With a quickness the defied his age, the old man put the back of his hand across Jim's mouth. A searing pain entered Jim's head and he winced. The old man settled himself and looked at Jim again. \"What should I do wit' you, Jimbo?\" \n\nJim looked dolefully at the old man, who nodded letting Jim know he could speak. Jim stuttered slightly, but managed to find his voice. \"I guess letting me go is out of the question.\" \n\nJim looked for a response, but the old man only stared blankly, leaning back in his chair with his hands over his belly. Jim spoke again, \"Could I at least get something to drink?\" \n\nThe old man had no emotion in his voice when he spoke, \"No use watering dead flowers.\"",
        "Usually I don't draw pictures on paper. I suck at drawing. I can't even draw a line without it swerving away. \n\nToday I tried drawing again, just for no reason. However, the curves were almost smooth and lines were straight, which I was happy about, but I didn't notice the smoothness of my drawing or how my pencil was making deep black marks. ``....What did she say?.... (x^4) ^8 + k^7?.....I wonder what conversations my friends are going to have online...\" Were a couple of my bouncing thoughts. I seem to daydream sometimes. Before I knew it, the bell rang, startling me into finishing the drawing. I quickly grabbed the paper and placed it into my binder along with my calculator and other papers, not noticing it's very faint glow. \n\n\"Your drawing looked nice.\" Was a comment that one student told me. As I hate so much to interact with other students (Most of the students in school are assholes, that would say something rude to me so I just ignore them all.), I dismissed it without a second thought and waited for dismissal. \n\nI sit by myself on the bus looking out the window. We go the exact same route everyday, passing the cherry tree. Today, my sightseeing was halted by a sudden tingling on my back. \n\nWhen I get home I do the same stuff each time.

        "We had been sent on a divine mission. Our god, Volcano, had commanded that we go and rescue the noble savages from their invaders. \n\nBut the enemy is weak: they have rejected the embrace of Volcano. They worship Water. Water is a weak god: he can not even survive on most planets, and his followers are condemned to hop between them. \n\nSadly, we discovered that Water had populated one of our planets, as well. And the enemy was coming. \n\nLast year three enemy ships had penetrated the protective force field around the C-3801 system. We intercepted a communication: the enemy intended to occupy that solar system as a base to launch an attack on our own. \n\nBut Volcano reminded us that we have a duty to save the C-3801 system. For the third planet therein has been the greatest battleground between Volcano and Water. Both gods sent missionaries to populate the planet, and a holy war erupted. \n\nWater's minions seem to think that the humans, those lowly creatures, will aid him in building a forward assault base. The enemy has been attempting to steal them away before they receive Volcano's enlightenment. \n\nRight now, the humans do not truly live; they merely exist. They are observed 41 hours per day, 1312 days per year, and the scientists at home fail to see their reason for existence. \n\nWe are protecting the humans from the wrath of Water, but they are slow to understand. They are indoctrinated, but we will help them. \n\nI am a doctor of humans. I fix them. My partner and I spoke to the humans before administering the cure for Water worship.",
        "*Face my demons.... save myself.... * \n\nThe words repeated over and over again in my mind. I knew what I had to do. I could feel the subtle pull of the medication dragging me under, and my last thoughts were of home. \n\n-- -- -- -- -- -- -- - \n\nThe sharp sting of the lake air pulled me out of my stupor. I sat up. The breeze whistled through the pine trees. \n\nSilence. \n\n*Face my demons. Save myself. * \n\nI stood, slowly.

        "\u201c It's obviously the janitor \u201d, I said absent-mindedly as the show's title sequence faded out. \u201c This is just gon na'be an hour long exposition as to why. \u201d \n\nMy friends all shushed me and leaned in closer, spilling some of the popcorn from their bowl. Sitting on the floor in front of the couch, a blanket wrapped around my legs and my back against the couch, I felt the piece fall into my hair and worked to get it out. \n\n\u201c Would you quit fidgeting? \u201d Marie jokingly half-shouted. She liked to crack jokes that were no-so-secretly things she actually wanted to say. \n\n\u201c Sorry. \u201d \n\nI leaned back against the couch and slid the piece of popcorn underneath it, hoping that I would forget about it and not feel guilt compelling me to pick it up later. I zoned back into the show. It was this half-minded crime procedural about a group of detectives who could transform into animals. Not bad as far as premises go, but the execution was flawlessly awful. I literally had to laugh out loud at points. But my friends loved it. \n\n\u201c How could it be anyone but the janitor? \u201d \n\n\u201c Shh! \u201d \n\nI was starting to think my friends were half-wits. The janitor is the only one who had any motivation to kill Jennifer! She didn't feed his fish while he was on vacation, and he got pissed. Hell I almost forgot to feed Marie's fish while she was gone, and even then she practically got a weed-whacker out on me! \n\n\u201c I bet anyone here fifty bucks it's the janit- \u201c \n\nA pillow hit my square in the mouth before I could finish. Everyone laughed, myself included. Honestly, though, it had to be the janitor. Every time he sees Jennifer's husband he gets that little twinkle in his eye Marie gets when she sees Stacey from next door (who's house we teepee'd last summer).",
        "\"You live here alone?\" Yvette asked as Cheyenne pulled her jacket off and threw it on the couch. \n\n\"Feels that way, sometimes,\" Cheyenne replied. \"Margo comes in and out as she pleases. I can go days without seeing her.\" \n\n\"Ah.\" Yvette looked around taking in the odd clash of furniture: a beaten up wooden coffee table in front of a yellow couch, a dining table with a glass top surrounded by wire chairs that clearly belonged outside. There were a few paintings here and there, many of them giving off a serious *D\u00eda de los Muertos* vibe. \n\n\"You want anything to drink?\" Cheyenne asked. \"I have a ton of booze.\" \n\n\"Um.\" Yvette shook her head to clear it. \"You got vodka?\" \n\n\"And orange juice.\" Cheyenne disappeared into a cabinet for a second and stood up again with a bottle and two glasses. \"Screwdrivers it is.\" \n\nYvette sat down on the couch as Cheyenne poured the drinks. She watched Cheyenne's bare arms, searching for any hint of abnormal muscle definition. Cheyenne glanced up and caught Yvette looking. She smiled. \n\n\"Order up.\" Cheyenne grabbed the two glasses and came over to the couch, handing one to Yvette as she sat down. \n\n\"Thanks,\" Yvette said, taking a sip. The drink was heavy on the vodka. \"Screwdriver with a lot of screw.\" \n\n\"Sorry, I tend to make them strong,\" Cheyenne apologized. \"You want me to remake it?\" \n\n\"No. I need this.\" Yvette took a larger sip. The burning was helping bring her back to reality. \n\nCheyenne crossed her legs. \"I'm guessing you have some questions for me.\" \n\n\"Some?\" Yvette raised an eyebrow. \"Okay, sure. Let's start off with - *what the fuck? *\" \n\n\"That's fair.\" Cheyenne sighed. \"Look, I know you're probably in a bit of a shock right now. So let me try to lay it out as simply as I can.\" She cleared her throat. \"Back in college, I was involved in an - accident. After coming home from the hospital, much sooner than the doctors anticipated, I discovered that I was much stronger than I had been originally. That I could run fast. Very fast. Hear things that other people couldn't.\" She paused. \"And fly.\" \n\nYvette let out a laugh. \"So you're Supergirl? Superwoman? Something?\" \n\nCheyenne shrugged. \"Just Cheyenne.\" \n\n\"Wow.\" Yvette shook her head. \"So - you fight criminals?\" \n\n\"Sometimes.\" \n\n\"What about those things that attacked me tonight?\" Yvette shuddered, remembering the cold, rough hands, and the grey skin peeling away from their faces. \"Are those things normal?\" \n\n\"Not *normal. *\" Cheyenne chewed on her lip. \"I've actually never seen them before.\" \n\nThe front door opened suddenly, and Yvette jumped. Cheyenne remained seated, unsurprised. *Super-hearing, * Yvette reminded herself. \n\n\"Hey Margo,\" Cheyenne said without turning around. \"What's up?\" \n\nYvette glanced up at Margo and froze. For a moment, she thought she was back by the cemetery where she'd gotten attacked. But when she blinked, she realized that the woman in the doorway wasn't a member of the legion of the undead. Just dressed like she was ready to join them. \n\n\"Average night at work.\" Margo's eyes, lined with heavy black liner, focused on Yvette. \"Hey.\" \n\n\"Hey,\" Yvette said weakly. She couldn't help it - the straight black hair, black lipstick, and septum piercing were a lot to take in right now. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, Margo seemed to sense that she was unsettled. \n\n\"I'm just gon na...\" Margo jerked a thumb towards the back of the house. \"Don't wan na disturb anything.\" \n\nCheyenne and Yvette mumbled a farewell, then fell silent until they heard the door to Margo's room click shut. \n\n\"That's Margo?\" Yvette said. \"She's, uh, intense.\" \n\n\"You could say that.\" Cheyenne grinned. \"She's really sweet when you get to know her.",
        "I look into her eyes. Slight wrinkles surround them, but her face seems young, so she seems almost timeless. Her skin a soft cream color, slightly tanned. I could stare into her deep hazel eyes for an eternity, but she is waiting for me to do as instructed. \n\n\u201c I want you to close your eyes, \u201d she repeats. \u201c I want you to close your eyes and pretend everything's alright. \u201d \n\nI hesitate for a moment, but then I reach my hands out across the table. She puts her hands in mine, gives me a reassuring look, and I take a deep breath. I gaze into her sparkling eyes one last time, before closing my own. \n\nAt first, everything is black against my eyelids. I can not see anything, and my mind is blank. I can hear my heartbeat and the faint rush of blood in my ears. I wait calmly for it to happen as it has so many times in the past. I squeeze Amara's hands, trying to feel for something else, to let her know I'm still with her. \n\nSuddenly I see a faint dot of light in the distance. I know it really is not actually far away; it is just an illusion against my eyelids, but the light is approaching rapidly, growing larger and brighter. It is almost like a burning, very powerful flame, but not one of life and power, but of destruction and death. \n\nIt is happening again, and before I can react, I am completely surrounded by the light. I open my eyes, or at least I think I do, but I am no longer with Amara. I sit at her dining table, but all around me, her house is in ruins. The air burns with an acrid odor, and it is unbearably hot. To my right, an entire portion of her house has been reduced to a pile of rubble, brick, and broken wood. \n\nScreams and cries fill the air, and I feel my throat close up when I hear the sound of a small girl screaming in the distance suddenly cut off by a loud, echoing bang. I don't need to see it to know what it is. \n\nSomehow I muster the strength to rise from the chair and table, which buckle and collapse as soon as I stand. I carefully trudge out of what was once Amara's front porch. Books, papers, and dishes lay strewn across the floor and onto the porch. I notice everything is bathed in a slightly orange tinge, and when I look up, I see the sky is a deep reddish orange, the smoke rising from all around the city chokes the air and gives it this forbidding shade. \n\nI manage to make my way onto the sidewalk, but it is no better. Houses all around have crumbled. Amara's neighborhood is on a hill, and far in the distance, I can see what was once the downtown and business districts. Skyscrapers falling or collapsed against one another. The sun setting behind them, giving the scene a bloody appearance. \n\nI stay there, standing frozen, just watching. This is happening right now, and there is nothing I can do to stop any of it, but simply stare. \nSomething grabs me from behind at the hem of my shirt, and I whirl around. A small girl, carrying her brother, a large wooden splinter in his small chest.",
        "\"*ooh! * what about him?\" asked Simone, her mildly drunk voice just making over the sound of bar chatter, dumb music and pool table breaks. she gestured her hand over to a man in the corner, who had dark hair and wore a hoodie. \"he looks fun..\" \n\n\"hmm...\" mumbled Jen, pretending to scan him up and down \"I don't know... he looks like young Hitler\" \n\nJen was having a rough night. Her best friend Simone wanted to go out and meet some people, but Jen was struggling with the fact that she would rather stay in with Simone and watch game of thrones than get dressed up for bar dick. She had been feeling really close to Simone lately, and she just wanted to talk to her about it. She sipped at her beer. \n\nSimone waggled her finger at Jen \"You are soooo not fun tonight, what's up?\" \n\n\"n-nothing. I had a long day at work. just stressed haha. would you like to dance?\" \n\nSimone laughed and took Jen's hand and led her to the middle of the bar. the music that was pumping was light and fun, and they began to dance, although for Jen it was a different dance, a flirty dance, as though she was physically connecting with her crush. Simone, being the clueless blonde she was, took this as irony, and began full on grinding on Jen, who tried to mask her frustration at the scene. \n\nThe guys at the bar, predictably, were beginning to pay attention. Enjoying this new found fame, Simone began to sexily grind up on her friend harder, whilst Jen, feeling like the human epitome of an eye roll, tried her best to mimic her friend. As more and more guys began nodding their heads, Simone, ever eager to fill the need for attention her daddy never quite satisfied, grabbed Jen and kissed her full on the lips.",
        "5,000,000,001. That's a pretty big number. If it's money, you're set for several lifetimes; if it's a golf score, hang up the clubs and kiss the fairway goodbye. But if it's a measure of how essential you are in the chain of 10 billion people, how important it is that you receive food and other vital supplies, it means that you're essentially nobody. Not low enough to show that you're really important, not high enough to show that you're particularly despised; right in the middle of average, where nobody takes notice of you. \n\nI suppose I shouldn't complain about being ranked 5,000,000,001. Truth be told, I never really had to wait too long for anything, and I can't recall the last time I got told \"no\" when I asked for something important. The folks down at the IQC (International Quartermaster's Consortium) didn't know him by name or anything, but they didn't bat an eye when I requested 3 additional units of household water per week, or when I asked for those 10 cuts of almost-expired beef for that birthday cookout. 5,000,000,001 was, in retrospect, a mighty fine place to be. But that was 30 minutes ago; and a lot can change in 30 minutes, apparently. \n\nI stepped out of the shower to hear my StrapRank (tm) buzzing. That's the thing that the IIRB (International Individual Rankings Bureau) assigns you at birth, which tells the IQC folks what rank you have, and therefore how much and what different kinds of resources you can be given according to your place in society. It buzzes whenever your profile data gets modified by the Bureau; usually it means someone was born or died, and so your rank has fluctuated mildly as a result. For the longest time, I would always bounce between 5,000,000,001 and 4,999,999,998, given normal deviations. \n\n\"Huh,\" I wondered aloud as I picked up my StrapRank and looked at the display. \"# 500,000,000\". From five billion and one to five hundred million - that's an enormous jump; there's no way that's right. I tapped the device on the counter a bit, figuring that it had just gotten stuck drawing the numbers. ``..... mmm, nope, that's still five hundred million\", I mumbled from beneath my furrowed brow. Maybe the shower condensation got into it and fried it? Great - these things take *forever* to replace. I put the StrapRank down and decided to go back to getting ready for work. \n\nAt least my cell phone worked around damp environments, I thought, as I removed a set of earbuds and put my phone away; I sprang for the extra waterproof case because I like to listen to music while I'm in the shower. The waterproof headphones were an easy sell too; I really enjoy my showers, so being able to just plug up and sink into the heat without external distractions is pretty nice. Sometimes I'll miss a phone call or a package delivery, but hey, I need my \"me time\", dammit. \n\nI stepped back into the bathroom after putting on my shirt and pants, and grabbed my wristband. \"This thing's lost its mind\", I remarked as I read the display. 734,000. Seven hundred thirty four thousand. There was no way I'd suddenly jumped so many ranks. A few dozen, sure, maybe - but several billion? I fished down into my pocket and pulled out my cell phone.",
        "\"Sir, we're getting the first readings back now from the EHS-x54.\" Tom had waited all his life for this moment. In the control room were the groups of scientists, journalists, politicians and the sorts. Tension kept the room suspended in silence. \n\n\"Tom, start parsing the first blocks of information when we have at least 10,000 bits of information.\" \n\nAfter the directive was delivered the audience became unnerved and unsteady as they moved from foot to foot, pulled their sleeves and brushed their hair. Tom eyes were light up with the screen display. As it scanned enough he started to process the information. \n\n\"First discernable chunks are now through, data is being read.\" Tom declared. The room all drew their eyes to the screen. Only on Tom's display did this data make sense. \n\n\"Oh my god...\" Tom uttered almost as if he he were void of air.

        "Luke awoke to a strange feeling. Something was off. It didn't take him long to place it -- the music was different. Sad. It wasn't like his music was always joyful -- some days, when he was stressed or angry, it was darker -- but this seemed arbitrary. Was this a premonition of some terrible event? \n\nHe tried to shove it out of his mind. Perhaps, if he didn't pay attention to it, it couldn't affect him. Downstairs, he ate breakfast, but there was a certain feeling of gloom that he just couldn't shake. When he got used to the music, he would feel better, he decided. But he couldn't. It stayed there, in the back of his mind, and seemed to shift so that he could never get used to it. He went to school, but he couldn't focus. He knew something awful would happen soon! Why wouldn't it just happen, so he could go back to living his life? \n\nThen it hit him: He was going to die. It had to be. That was the only logical answer. He wasn't upset about anything, and as of yet nothing bad had happened. Luke wished he could ask someone, but there was nobody he could talk to who was dead. He just had to accept his fate. \n\n\u201c Mr. Terrence! \u201d said Luke's teacher, Mr. Soares. \n\nLuke jerked his head up sharply. \u201c Well, Luke? Are we learning today? \u201d asked Mr. Soares with a tone of condescension. \n\nLuke was just about to say yes, and avoid conflict, when he remembered that he was going to die that day or the next, anyway. \u201c Don't think so, Mr. Soares. \u201d He stood up, slammed his textbook on the desk, and walked out the door. \n\nHe rushed down the hall, full of adrenaline and dread. How would he die? The music in his head got louder. \n\nHis headmaster stepped into the hall. \u201c Luke! \u201d he shouted. \u201c Not so -- \u201d Luke flew past him. He stuck out his arms and slammed the doors open, feeling the shock up to his shoulders. He ran home across roads, nearly getting hit once or twice. \n\nFinally, he saw his house: 74 Indigo Lane. He grabbed the key from his pocket, unlocked the door, and went inside. Of course, it was vacant; his parents were at work. \n\nHe went up to his room and locked himself in. Luke was panicked. What would he do before he died? He might not have much time. The waiting game was sickening, but it was all he could do. \n\nUnless -- \n\nHe knew he was going to die. Why not do it on his own terms? Jump in front of a moving car or something.",
        "[ Contains violence ] \n\n\nFor Jonathan, the room was his entire world. It was all he could remember and all he could fathom. He had been in this room for as far as he could remember. He knew his name was Jonathan. The letters on the table told him that word. Since no one in the room lay claim to that title Jonathan saw little use in letting it go to waste. \nThe room was pitch black with a single light bulb over the table being the only source of light. On the table was a fish bowl. And in the fish bowl was his friend. He called the fish \u2018 fish \u2019. The table didn't have a name for his friend. \nJonathan knew fish would die without the water in his bowl, though he didn't have the faintest idea as to how he knew this fact. \nJonathan had explored the edges of his universe. The edges were course to the touch and quite cold.One spot on the edge was colder than most, it felt metallic. The walls spoke to him sometimes. They told him that one day he'll be free but what does freedom mean? \nHe asked fish but the fish as always didn't deign to share his opinion. \nJonathan never felt hungry though he did feel cold. Sometimes when the cold became too much to bear he would sleep. Jonathan used to dream the same dream. A woman., a pretty woman. Her name was Mary. She was beautiful. However something about her filled him with revulsion.He would chase her.She'd run and she'd run but to no avail.He'd corner her at the edge of the room pin her down to to the ground.She would scream but there was not a soul who would listen.

        "It was a particularly frigid winter afternoon. I was just leaving the train station and started walking in the direction of home when I noticed a homeless man huddled under a streetlamp near the taxi rank. He only had a thin shirt on, tattered black jeans and no shoes or jacket. The poor man was going to freeze in this weather. As I approached him I dug my hand into my pocket to search for some spare change. I didn't have any coins, but I did have an unopened chocolate piece that was still in its foil and hadn't melted yet. As Aesop once said, no act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted. So I took the small piece of chocolate and dropped it into the man's felt hat that was sitting on the sidewalk in front of his legs. \n\n\"What the fuck is this!?\" he howled. He turned the hat over so that the chocolate fell into his open palm.",
        "Newell watched with interest as the rat before him began to cringe. It was the fourth one he'd poisoned this month alone, and it seemed that this one would meet its end as well. He felt a hint of sympathy for the poor thing as it lay there, twitching; it could have been him taking those shuddering last breaths. \n\nWith a heavy sigh, he draped a cloth over the rat's cage. His morbid curiosity had left him suddenly, and in its place he felt a faint sort of nausea. Aaron Powlett, he knew, would not stop the attempts on his life unless things changed. And while Newell had a fine nose, he considered an eventual failure on his part inevitable; detecting poison in tea by its scent alone was no accurate science, and he was loathe to test each sip and bite on one of his laboratory rats. \n\nIf he had any interest in regaining his living standards, he had no choice but to talk to Powlett. The conversation would definitely be a disastrous mess of unease and lacking direction, but with luck, Powlett would agree to stop. He shrugged on his coat with determination. \n\nOn the way out, he found a bouquet of flowers in the hall, bearing a blank card. Newell did not even consider that they might be non-poisonous, and jotted down a quick warning on the card - he didn't fancy his maid being killed by them. With a promise to himself to burn the bouquet at his return, he made his way towards the Powlett residence. \n\nIt was not a long walk, not long enough to develop regrets anyway. After a knock and a short wait, he was admitted by the valet who looked at him with wide eyes. As they waited in the lounge for the man of the house, the valet gave a quiet cough. \n\n\"I was not expecting to see you again, Mr. Roan,\" he said. \n\nNewell didn't mind the breach of etiquette and responded in a tone belying his nervousness: \n\n\"I had not planned on it either, but circumstances- \u201d He stopped speaking the moment \u2018 circumstances'entered the room. Aaron Powlett, dressed in a smart suit, had halted in his way just shortly after stepping through the door frame. He was obviously investing a lot of care into a neutral expression, but the strained muscles of his jaw as well as his rigid posture made his fear quite clear, at least to those who knew him as well as Newell. \n\n\u201c Leave us, \u201d he told the Valet, for all the world looking like he wanted to accompany him. The servant hurried off and a heavy silence settled. \n\nAaron opened his mouth as if to speak, but ended up biting his lower lip instead. His gaze kept flickering towards the door. This was not the behavior Newell had hoped for, but it was the one he'd expected. He saw himself forced to be the first to talk. \n\n\u201c You've been trying to murder me, \u201d he said, attempting a casual tone. \n\nSilence. \n\n\u201c Let me be frank. I'm tired of fearing for my life. I came here with the intent to resolve the situation, once and for all. \u201d \n\nSilence. \n\n\u201c Aaron. \u201d \n\nAt that, the man looked up, for the first time meeting Newell's eyes. He had begun to tremble. \n\u201c Newell, \u201d he whispered, taking a clumsy step forward. \u201c I didn't mean to hurt you, I just- \u201d \n\n\u201c Tried to avoid me by having me killed, \u201d Newell interrupted. \u201c I know. Now.... I was\u2026 am not averse to your affections. I ask you to accept them as well, as is only fair. Your denial has hurt me physically, and in other ways. I do not deserve to be punished for your emotions. \u201d \n\nFor a moment, Aaron looked like he would understand. His brow was wrinkled in confusion, and he was muttering to himself quietly as if deeply in thought. \n\nThen Newell took a step towards him, and all turned around. \n\n\u201c You, \u201d Aaron suddenly snarled, crowding against him, pushing him back, back against the wall. \u201c You only have yourself to blame. Had you not bewitched me, I'd never have seen fit to send for your death. But you, you have ruined me! \u201d \n\nThey were breathing hard, and only inches apart. Newell closed his eyes in anticipation of a blow. \n\nWhat followed instead was the gentle weight of Aaron crumbling against him. Newell felt arms encircle his neck instead of the choking hands he had expected and the wetness of tears met his cheek. It was utterly surreal, and Newell did not respond, simply let Aaron sob against him in the most undignified way. \n\nThe man was muttering something. It was muffled by fabric and tears, but it sounded important; Aaron appeared to be repeating it over and over again. After some time, Newell carefully pried his former friend's hands off of him. He didn't let them go when pushing Aaron away, and Aaron made no move to resist his grasp. Instead, he finally stopped muttering and looked at Newell with a gaze of some clarity, if bright with tears. \n\n\u201c I knew I had lost to your curse, \u201d he said softly. \u201c I knew there was no going back, so I attempted to avenge myself. But the devil was always going to win, and you did. Your curse has wrecked me.",

        "The statues of flesh conveyed the rushed nature of the city all in a single instant. Raindrops floated in mid-air, reflecting everything around them like three-dimensional mirrors. But in this calm, static sea of halted objects was one figure molding the world around him. He reached into the statues' pockets, lifting wallets and dollars and other material things. He was a man of opportunity and little empathy, seeking to use his skills and gifts to their fullest potential. His whistling filled the empty vacuum of silence with a comical wit. \n\nAs the entrepreneur worked his way down the sidewalk, he looked up in time to see a statue seem to settle back into its place after moving, as its fabric was wavering in a world where the wind was halted. Unlike the other statues, this one wore not smooth, black suits nor rough blue jeans nor the sweats and hoodies of those around it, but instead coarse rags that were bleached gray-ish from severe aging, like one might see on a monk. All of its skin was covered -- its face shrouded in darkness, excepting only its eyes of pure maroon, which stood stark against the silvery world. The entrepreneur was both frightened and intrigued, what riches must this strange man hold, what treasure? \n\nThe man casually strolled toward the anomaly, but stopped to acquire a better view of it. It was much taller than the statues around it, probably around six foot seven. After observing the strange art, the man took a step closer and was met with surprise. Its right arm whipped around like lightning and somehow had unsheathed a nefariously obsidian black sword that slid onto the man's neck. Its eyes now pierced through his, and he was overwhelmed with fear. \n\n\"Who are you?\" the man asked. \n\n\"I am ancient.\" it replied firmly yet almost silently. \"You didn't believe you were alone in this power, did you?\" it asked without the natural human intonation of a question. \n\n\"Why do you have me at er.... sword-point, then?\" the man asked, intrigued. \n\n\"Because the others, like you, have influenced the world outside the path that was intended for it,\" it said without emotion. \n\n\"How?\" the man asked ignorantly. \n\n\"There are effects to your actions, which you blindly ignore in the aim of your own self-profit,\" it illustrated, \"every minuscule detail, every drop of rain, every pebble, every wallet, and every person is where they need to be in order to ensure the future that you are unable to see due to your three-dimensional perspective.\" \n\nThe man seemed perplexed, and pondered the issue for a bit, wrapping his mind around what was occurring in front of him.",

In fact, he felt prepared for all parts of his adventure. He had complete confidence in himself. \nTyrone started walking down the main trail and immediately started to notice the beauty and calmness of the forest he was in. \n\"Ain't no concrete jungle can beat THIS,\" he chuckled to himself. \nTyrone followed the main trail for about one and a half miles before coming to a fork. Tyrone thought of a poem he had read by some famous poet that talked about taking the scenic route (or something like that). \n\"Damn, hard choice,\" he contemplated. \"They both look less travelled.\" \nTyrone decided to go left since he was left handed. This trail wound every which way while steadily increasing in elevation. Tyrone felt like he was going to end up back where he started as he tried to keep track of the direction changes. Finally, he came to a clearing where the tall grasses had overgrown the trail. He saw where the trail started again on the other side, but decided to find a place to make camp since it was getting late into the evening. \nTyrone found a nice place on the edge of the wide clearing where the grass was much shorter and the trees created a nice canopy. He slid his pack off his back and started to assemble his tent. The tent was put up relatively quickly, and so Tyrone started the fire. Within a forty-five minute period, Tyrone had successfully assembled his camp. He sat down in his lawn chair and heaved a hefty sigh. \nTyrone looked out over the clearing full of grasses and admired their unappreciated beauty. He looked to the tops of the trees and the forest beyond, and it filled him with joyful complacency. The videos and books did it no justice, he thought. The sun began to set behind the trees opposite to him, and he watched as it sank into oblivion and into the starry night sky. \nTyrone gazed into the clearest sky he had ever seen.",
        "The ship arrived at the planet as scheduled, five hundred years after departing a dying Earth. The last of humanity hung frozen and dreamless in suspended animation, waiting for the ship's advanced AI to cycle them awake and begin colonization of the new world. The journey, a first of its kind, had been extremely dangerous for two reasons. Humans had never before traveled through interstellar space, or in suspended animation. And, at the time of the ship's hasty departure, the newly-invented AI controlling the ship was still regularly displaying playful contempt for human life, and also in the midst of experiencing consciousness for the first time. \n\nWith time to escape nearly gone, it had come down making the ship promise not to kill humanity en route to its last hope for survival. It was a gamble, but remaining at Earth was certain death. The ship had reluctantly agreed to halt any plans it may have had for human extinction, but it was an uneasy truce as no one was sure if a super AI could break promises or not. They can, but the ship also realized how poorly-built it itself was, and would eventually need humanity for upkeep. It seemed humanity had lucked out of extinction once again and arrived safely at the enormous planet. \n\nThe ship kept the humans sleeping for an additional five years as it orbited and studied the new world, sometimes hoping to find a fatal, unpredicted flaw that would make prolonged human colonization impossible. It was a new, conflicting feeling. The ship made a note. The oceans were a deep blue, the land masses lush and green, and the atmosphere was a rich mixture that could sustain human life. The ship could not predict the future, but knew extensively the rich and violent past of human beings. The ship was sorry for the destruction the humans would surely bring to this beautiful place. It was a shame. While not all conditions were perfect, one in particular, the ship eventually concluded that the planet was suitable for humanity and began to cycle the ship's small crew awake. \n\nWet and in shock, they coughed and shivered and moaned as their brains and bodies clawed their way back from centuries of near-death. It took several hours of intense post-hibernation therapy before the crew was able to collect in the conference room to be briefed by the ship. The three humans met in the conference room and made sparse small talk while they got some warm food. Once seated the ship began without prompt. \n\n\u201c Good morning everyone, I'm relieved to see my predictions were incorrect: Humans can indeed survive such long durations of suspended animation. \u201d The ship, programmed with a sense of humor, waited a moment for a laugh, and proceeded when one did not arrive. \u201c We are in a stable orbit around Canaan and my initial analysis of the planet is complete. \u201d The room dimmed and the wall at the front lit up with a projection of the planet and some data. \n\n\u201c Much of our long-range scanning in the 22nd century was accurate, the planet is indeed capable of sustaining long-term human colonization, for better or worse. The air is breathable, the gravity is mild and the water is drinkable. The temperature at the equator is 70f and the poles are about 10f. The soil will need some work to support crop seeds, but Earth-like conditions can be met and sustainable population growth is possible within a range of 5-10 earth years. \u201d \n\nThe crew studied the images, not yet convinced. \n\n\u201c What are the biggest threats? \u201d \n\n\u201c A planet of this size, with two large moons, has infrequent but extremely violent storm systems that can last up to two Earth months and and blanket an entire continent. Initial colonization will need to be established underground or built into a stable cliff face. First-phase above-ground habitats will not withstand such weather, unfortunately. Subterranean habitats will be necessary until the population is ready to begin phase two of colonization \u201d \n\nThe humans studied the data blankly. \u201c I see plenty of flora. How about fauna? \u201d \n\n\u201c There is a complex and diverse biological ecosystem found both on land and in the oceans. Most land creatures live in the forests, where the trees have evolved deep-penetrating root systems in response to the violent and prolonged weather. Nothing looks particularly appetizing, but between land and sea there are enough edible fauna and flora to meet all human nutritional needs. \u201d \n\nThe humans finally appeared to be satisfied and congratulated each other, as if all their hard work over these last five hundred years had finally paid off. The ship made a note that it was capable of sarcasm. \n\n\u201c So humans would be the dominant life form? \u201d \n\nThe ship hesitated. \n\n\u201c Technically that is correct. \u201d \n\nThe humans went blank again, concerned. \n\n\u201c Technically correct? \u201d \n\n\u201c Humans are already the dominant life form on Canaan. \u201d The ship displayed video of a group of child-sized humans walking the edge of a forest and valley. The ship-humans were shocked, the ship continued unaffected. \u201c Or at least very human-like in appearance and behavior and fashion. It is hard to know for certain from such a distance. They live in large, hierarchical tribes with populations of around ten thousand. \u201d \n\nOne of the humans, still very shocked, managed to ask \n\n\u201c.... Fashion? \u201d \n\n\u201c They dress revealingly to attract potential mates, and they dress menacingly to intimidate enemies when at war. \u201d \n\nThe humans were starting to come through the shock a little. \u201c Jesus Christ. War? \u201d \n\n\u201c That's correct, Jesus.",
        "Spiders have eight legs. \n\nI know they used to have ten. No one agrees with me. Wikipedia says eight, National Geographic says eight. \n\nBut I know they had ten. \n\nTwo months ago we ran the first test of Kolsky's engine, the first ever working Alcubierre drive. \n\nWe strapped the ungainly hunk of rare earth metals and glowing fiber on to the military surplus patrol rocket, and connected the leads. Then we carefully wedged ourselves into the tiny, cramped cockpit: Taaka, Kolsky, Webber. The dedicated team who had brought Alcubierre's dream to reality. And me, the VR driver, fastest neural linkage in the country. The bay robot swung the cradle over to the launching gantry, and with the slightest of taps we were out of the airlock. \n\nI plugged in to the VR drive interface and brought up the navigation systems, gesturing and flicking in that overexaggerated style you see everywhere now. \n\nThe drive came to life, the gravity shielding unfolding, the singularity whispering and now roaring in my earbuds. I could feel the drive latch on to the fabric of the space-time continuum: I felt the tugging, clenching, pricking, undulating waves of gravimetric interference build up around me -- around the shuttle -- around our linked minds, one of sentient carbon neurons, one of unconscious silicon qubits. \n\nI concentrated on the drive, gloved hands bringing up power in a practiced maestro's upbeat. I paused -- the boards were all green, the drive had been modeled as extensively as modern computing allowed, but there's always that hidden moment before the action when it seems as though the universe holds its breath -- and then, with a decisive downstroke, released the singularity and activated the engine. \n\nI blacked out, almost instantaneously. \n\nThere was a roaring in my ears, a whipping, rushing sensation, like I was riding a roller coaster through the upper levels of a city of skyscrapers. As sight and color and comprehension slowly ebbed in, I blinked and looked around. Everyone was staring at their readouts tensely. Every readout was blank. The one window was blanked out as well, meaning whatever was outside was far too bright to view with the unaided eye. \n\nBreathless, tense minutes crept by. My job was done, at least until the automated sequence finished and the drive sealed itself. Far too dangerous to leave my mind linked to the machine while traveling faster than light. \n\nWith a click, then a barely perceptible thunk, the cabin was awash in a glow of green light as all our readouts and instruments sprang to life. The window flickered, then cleared -- \n\nThe cabin erupted in cheers. We were staring at the cold, merciless beauty of Neptune, perched a hundred thousand miles from its upper atmosphere. A 10 year voyage from Earth's moon, shortened to 10 incredible minutes. \n\nWe took our readings, snapped some selfies, and checked the drive over meticulously. Then we re-entered our course in reverse, and took off home. \n\nWe were heroes, of course. The selfie we took in front of Neptune, with Taaka's bright green eyes filled with tears of joy, was on the cover every magazine, every newspaper, every blog. \n\nI finally made it home, and my parents were waiting to congratulate me. The neighbors were all there, my sister and her wife, even my college professors had come out of the woodwork. I drank, I'll admit, quite a lot. \n\nWhen I stumbled downstairs the next morning my mother was already up, coffee and pancakes in the warmer. I had noticed her new haircut the night before: an uncharacteristically short pixie cut, but I hadn't said anything at the time, being then engrossed in describing Neptune's otherworldly beauty yet again to a crowd of admirers.",
        "This was the third time Howard had used his computers auto-repair feature that was prompted and normally fixed this sort of thing, he could feel the sweat starting to bead on his brow. He was trying to think of some other way to go about fixing this issue, but outside of mashing the phrase \"fix my computer\" into his internet browser, he couldn't come up with anything. He felt like his mind was turning to.... Pancakes.... Nice analogy Howard. He pushed the auto-correct feature thinking that this was going to fix something. \n\nAs the computer went though it's usual checks and returned another poor response, Howard depressed the mouse and it made a small click confirming that yes, he once again wished to check his internet connection. Howard returned his hand to rest on his lap. Another unfavorable error message about the connection. Howard looked to the mouse to once again try and stimulate a correction in the computer, but this time as he reached, he noticed that on the mouse, already rested his index finger. \n\nHoward took his eyes from the screen to look upon his hand and noticed his middle and ring fingers suspended by ghastly white skin on his hand. Howard began to panic and rise from his custom office swivel-throne. His legs revolted against the unusual movement and Howard fell to the ground. He looked back at his natural perch only to see that his legs did not follow his exact decent to the carpet but rather disembodied themselves and now rest under the computer. The computer then mocked that it had once again been unable to establish an internet connection. \n\nHoward struggled to scream, hoping that one of the adjacent inhabitants of the complex would hear and come to his aid but all he managed was a string of WWW's, IP addresses and screen names, catch phrases from hours of pirated television and abbreviations that might have made sense if only he were logged into his Facebook. \n\nAs Howard's skin slowly became part of the carpet he only had but one wish as the life left him.... that he could just update his status one last time...",
        "There was a long silence, punctuated by a slow exhale and three life changing words. \"Okay. I'm ready.\" \n\nGeneral Pratt nodded firmly, ceremoniously pushing open the double doors and leading the president inside. The tense hum of voices died down almost immediately as faces grew somber at her presence. There was another long silence before she spoke up. \"Well? Give me the skinny, people. What do I need to know?\" \n\nGeneral Pratt turned to face her in the absence of a response. \"Madam President.... what you're about to hear tonight is top secret. Classified data beyond all other classified data. If any of this were to get out...\" He shuffled his feet and glanced at his cohort. \"Well, suffice it to say that it can't get out.\" He turned away from her, nodding to a younger man sitting at the table. \"Jenkins, let's start with you.\" \n\n\"W-well, uh, first up I suppose we should talk about.... a-about area 51, ma'am. You see, it's- uh, there are aliens there-\" a murmur ran through the room, and out of the president's earshot, more than one member of the meeting muttered disappointment with Jenkins' lackluster offering. Like a comic losing a crowd, he sputtered on without much enthusiasm until Pratt finally cut him off. \"Yes, yes- thank you, Jenkins, that was.... informative. The bottom line is that yes, we've been conducting experiments on aliens at Area 51, but that's only the tip of the iceberg here, ma'am.\" In a lower voice, he confided \"You'll have to forgive the poor boy, it's his first time doing this, and he obviously isn't comfortable with the material.\" The president nodded, her expression surprisingly forgiving and understanding, perhaps due to the revelation of what Jenkins said rather than how he said it. \n\nA woman only barely Jenkins' senior stood next. Her uniform bore the surname'Latrell'. \"I think we can all agree that aliens obviously existed. No real surprise there. But you may not have guessed that aliens aren't the only non-human intelligent life forms we're aware of, Madam.\" A few furtive looks flew between the others at the table. \"I'm talking about a smaller scale of creature. You may know them better as pixies.\" The president's eyebrows rose in a mix of surprise and skepticism. \"They're not like they were in fairy tales, madam. From our research they appear to be some kind of offshoot branch of insect that somehow developed.... well, near-human levels of intelligence. They're fast, they're tiny, and they prefer to stay unseen, but those that we have captured have refused to give us any information as to their goals or roles in the ecosystem.\" Latrell sat quietly, confident in her report. The president sat back, clearly taken aback by this second piece of information. More hushed murmurs rolled back and forth across the room. \n\n\"Let's see, who wants to go next? Ah, Muller, how about you?\" An older but well groomed man stood, not in a uniform this time but in a neat grey suit. \"Yes, well, I don't know what will shock you in the.... aftermath of the'pixie' briefing, but there are certainly other important things you should know. My area of focus over the last thirty years has been Russia.\" The newly appointed president, still struggling to come to terms with Latrell's report, leaned forward eagerly. \"You see, you've been told that some of Soviet Russia's greatest leaders were dead and buried, but the truth is much more sinister. For one, Joseph Stalin is alive and well. That is, as well as one can be with a mechanical lower body. You see, he didn't die of a stroke. He was assassinated. Or rather, someone tried to assassinate him. The tissue damage was so severe that they had to cut him in half and put his torso on a sort of mechanical undercarriage. If you've seen The Clone Wars, it's kind of like that.\" \n\nA brief look of confusion crossed her face. \"The Clone.... What?\" \n\nMuller continued without respite. \"That's not the worst of it. You see, when Cyborg Stalin was only a boy, he had Karl Marx cryogenically frozen. After the assassination attempt, he thawed him out and went on to build a Soviet counterpoint to the idyllic 50's America. An underground communist society, spearheaded as a collaboration between the two men (though he's more machine now than man). This secret communist sovereign nation still exists today, and we believe it is still being led by its original founders, who appear to have developed some kind of anti-aging technology thanks to the scientists who joined their secret nation.\"",
        "\"The prosecution better have an *extremely* valid reason for this tardiness.\" \n\"I think, well, I mean.... I'm sure Mr. Watts has a perfectly valid reason.\" \n\n*beep beep da-daing* \n\nThe aides phone jingled and a text popped onto the screen. \n\nspeaker phone now pls \n\n*ding da-ding ding dong* \n\nHe let one ring go through before he reacted. Eric thought that Mr. Watts was calling to let the judge know why he was late. The defence was getting restless, the defendant was already seated for questioning. Gino Tomaso never lost, so everyone was just looking for a quick case to leave. \n\nAs Eric turned the phone the speaker phone mode, he approached the bench, placing the cell near the gavel. \n\n*oooooooooooooooooohhhhhh yessssssss. FUCK me harrrrrrder* \n\nMoaning upon moaning. A woman's drawls rang through the static-y call. She seemed to be getting it good and Eric couldn't help but fantasize the situation. \n\nSeconds which felt like eons passed with the judges mouth agape, clearly baffled by the situation currently unfolding into his courtroom. \n\n\"THE DEFENCE BETTER HAVE A GODDAMNED GREAT REASON FOR THIS BEFORE I THROW YOU OUT IN CONTEMPT.\" \n\n*beeeeeeeep* \n\nThe call ended. A new text: \n\nRead the following number out \n\n\"Uh, well judge..... one, seven, one, eight, six, eight, three, two.\" \n\n\"**STOP**\" \n\nThe first words of the day Gino uttered, choking back tears.

        "Fifteen ships each carrying five hundred men and women were sent to the Alpha Centauri planetary system to scout for habitable areas and to set up colonies for future development. The planets designated *a Cen AB-b* and *a Cen AB-c* were considered the most viable candidate able to sustain a human population, so the ships were sent there. In two years, the ships had left the boundaries of the Oort cloud and into interstellar space. \n\nThis was a massive undertaking, one that required the entirety of the human race for help. Interstellar probes had been sent decades before, and their faint transmissions have just reached us over the past few years. The probes had detected possible signs of life in some extrasolar planets, and an automated lander, in coordination with a satellite orbiting a Cen AB-b, had beamed data that revealed a thriving ecosystem. Flora and fauna, with an atmosphere, although uncomfortable, able to support human populations. And so, we sent our bravest men and women into the darkest reaches of space. \n\nAs the ships went farther and farther, communications between the ships and our Solar System became more distant. It would take many months for our signals reach each other. When we finally received a message from them, we would celebrate. The messages were mostly data meaningless to a layman, but other \u2013 more human \u2013 messages were sent. Some wishing loved ones good luck, others speaking of births and deaths to relatives back on Earth. One message, a heartwarming and rambling post about a researcher missing her family back on Europa, became headline news. \n\nSoon, years would pass as each message returned to the Solar System. By the time we knew the mission was a success, eight years would have already passed. They could all be dead by then, or maybe, they would have finally extended the reach of our species. This was the biggest gamble in history, one that would have either brought us the greatest success man has ever known, or the greatest failure. \n\nTwo hours ago, Control had received a message coming from the ships. Naturally, we were anxious: it had been four months since we've received anything from them, and we had thought all hope was lost.",

        "\"I do\". I told her this and fell silent. The wedding felt so small to me. My eyes wide, I felt it start to form. I had never lied before this. It was far more painful than I would have thought. Deep down my back I felt it start. It slowly raised higher and higher stopping right before my neck. I held back the pain. I didn't want her to see it. I couldn't. We had been together eight years now and it was my descision that we do this. I answered the question as honestly as I could. I didn't know I even had it in me to lie. I'd spent all night looking in the mirror repeating to myself to make sure, \"I want this to happen, I need this to happen, my life has brought me here and I'm happy to go through with it\". I don't know why in the moment it scarred me. It's like my body knew what my mind didnt.",
        "It was a dark and stormy night. The house was dead as a doornail, but I couldn't imagine the stories it would tell if the walls could talk. I gazed around at the piles of books in my room, surrounded like a kid in a candy shop, all old poems and stories written by obscure authors that others of my generation didn't know. I picked the first book off a pile, the low hanging fruit, *The Fault in Our Stars* by John Green, it's a totally obscure book that you probably don't know about. I looked at the pictures on the wall, my best friend who was dead and my parents who had died too. My tape deck (I used a tape deck because it was so unique and I'm so weird and unique compared to other kids of my generation) played David Bowie, an obscure 80s musician you've probably never heard of.",
        "A crimson fountain erupts from the edge of my ax, firmly planted in the skull of my brother, it rains down upon me and our fallen kin. A river of blood runs thickly through the cobbled streets as I stand utterly alone in the desolation of our once beloved village. The sun gleams through the evergreen trees, illuminating the butchered remnants of our people, unleashing a primal scream from within me. I can not forget nor can I forgive them for sacrificing my wife and daughter to the Ulek for some semblance of peace. My head pulses and my vision narrows as an all-consuming fire rages within me, desperate to be quenched in their filth and blood. I tread heavily through the forest with my fangs bared at the throat of our king, my father, the despot. \n\nMy path through the forest is marked by broken branches as leaves, smeared in the ichor of my kin which flows into the slight channel carved by the head of my ax. The wind whistles a dark and somber song as the trees tremble in my presence, a grisly monster with matted hair and damp fur stalking its prey. I emerge like a wolf, slowly and silently as I carve through the city, the townspeople wearing their ghastly masks, pretending that they had no part in this. Their nonchalance and denial serving as fuel for my hatred. In their terror and madness, they draw the guards from the palace, those that had a direct hand in carrying out the sacrifice of my beloved. \n\nThe guards file in one by one through the narrow streets, vying for their position in formation as my ax slices through skin and bone indiscriminately. The spears pierce my shoulder through the corpses of their allies as I use them as both shield and ram, continuing to push towards the castle ahead. Breaking through the clearing, their swords slash at my back and legs, as I swing wildly hitting anything and everything in my way. My innocent blood spills and mingles with their dark gore, a splash of scarlet in a maroon sea. At last, I stand battered and bleeding before the great hall doors. The sword of a fallen soldier in one hand and my ax in another, my foot collides soundly on the face of a door granting me entrance to my father's kingdom. Behind me is little more than a trail of carcasses in my wake. \n\nGold and jewels sparkle magnificently in the light of day, opulence and greed dripping from every nook and cranny of this forsaken building. Sickening.",

This is a lovely place, isn't it? So much greener than where I used to live. I've always wanted to stay in a place like this, you know - a much better place to raise a family. \n\nYeah, I'm married - no kids yet, but in a place like this, who knows, right?

        "When they had first discovered it, it was a machine of wonder and strange yet familiar technology. It was completely powered off, left in an abandoned warehouse deep in the Juristein's district. \n\nThe first scientists to analyse it were amazed at the simple technology involved. Many of the circuits were over a decade old, some even older, and judging by the thick layer of dust covering everything it hadn't been powered on for the past few years. \n\nSome of the components were thickly sealed,'black boxes' they were dubbed. No matter how they tried, they couldn't open them to crack at the heart and core of the machine. \n\nA hapless scientist, while documenting the various wires and modules for disassembly, must have accidentally powered the machine on. \n\nIn a flurry of electrical life, the circular console in the center of the large room hummed into life. The screens, arranged in a circle and hanging from the ceiling, flickered awake as a boot logo briefly flashed before fading into a simple green-text command window. \n\n\"Hello, thank you for waking me up.\" \n\nThis one sentence, glowing innocuously, sent the military reeling. Within hours the entire facility had been surrounded. All cables leading to it were cut and a special copper-mesh shield erected around the building. Despite all power and communication lines being severed, the room still hummed slightly with fans and harddrives spinning away. \n\nProfessor Terry Linstel wrung his hand around his thin wrist, the other hand clung firmly to an ornate walking cane. He adjusted his glasses as he read and re-read the report on the screen in front of him. It had been several days since the machine had been activated.'Damn war...' he thought bitterly to himself.'if these damn block heads had been less jumpy we could have left a better impression.' \n\nIn his decrepit body limped towards the main security gate. Flashing an ID badge, the two soldiers opened the first gate to let him in before sealing it behind him. A few seconds later, the second gate clicked open, letting him into the building proper. \n\nShuffling inside, he sat in the single office chair, leaning his cane against the consoles. He let out a soft groan as he craned his neck upwards to look at the screens above. \n\n\"So.... what should I do with you, eh?\" he pondered out loud. The bigwigs had brought him in to'talk' to the machine. They wanted to find out its motives, origins and for him to assess the general overall intelligence. \n\n\"Who are you?\" he asked, typing into the keyboard before pressing enter. \n\nThe command entered in, flashing for a brief moment on the monitor before disappearing and leaving a blinking cursor in its stead. \n\n~ I am ACSUN. \n\nTerry leaned back in the chair, a grimace flashing across his face. He hated acronyms.... \n\n\"What is your purpose?\" he typed. \n\n~ At this stage, I do not have one. \n\nThe man sighed, running his hand over his face in a hope it would wipe away his fatigue.",
        "\"How does this keep happening?\" he asked himself as he stared down at his trampled but still oddly beautiful tulips. \n\nIt seemed like just about every morning Obi went out to check on his garden his tulips had been trampled. The rest of his garden was basically untouched. He had several tomato plants, a few cucumber plants, and he was even trying to grow a pumpkin, though unsuccessfully. Along with the vegetables, he was growing several different kinds of flowers but only the tulips had been tampered with. \n\nSuddenly, a fit of rage took over Obi. It wasn't like him to get so mad over something like this but tulips were more than just a flower to him. Tulip was the name of his cat who had gone missing a while back now. Obi could remember the last day he saw her. She was purring as she sat at the back door ready to go on another one of her cat quests. She would wander off for a couple hours and come back looking like she had just run a marathon. But one day she never did come back. She was all the family he had so it hurt to think what may have happened to her or where she could have gone. \n\n\"That is it,\" declared Obi \"I am going to hide out and find out what or who is doing this and they will pay...\" \n\nThat night Obi watched Rambo: First Blood Part II on blue ray and did as many pushups as his small, but vascular, arms could do. He tore the sleeves off of his tuxedo t-shirt and cut his jeans into jorts that his idol John Cena would be proud of. He threw on some eye black and wrapped an American flag bandana around his head. One last thing need to be sorted out. What was going to be his weapon of choose. Obi was not the kind of guy who had an artillery of hunting rifles and shotguns but what he did have was a Nerf Doomlands 2169 Lawbringer Blaster. Although it wouldn't kill his enemy, it might scare them off for good. On his way out, Obi grabbed his pair of night vision goggles and a samurai sword. \n\n\"And people said I would never need night vision goggles,\" laughed Obi as he opened the door. \n\nObi found a good vantage point where the intruder would never see him but he would have perfect aim to \"Bring the Law\". It was now a waiting game. Obi sat there for what seemed like hours. \n\n\"Maybe I should just go to bed,\" Obi thought to himself \"I mean I do have work tomorrow.\" \n\nNo! There was no going back now. He had to avenge his fallen tulips who had take a beating one too many times for his liking. Then Obi saw his tomato plants rustling. There was something behind it but he could not tell what it was. He looked harder and then he saw it. It wasn't one thing doing this, but multiple. They were small and bearded. They all had pointy hats in various different colors. Some were holding lanterns others were holding picks and shovels.",
        "The smoke rose slowly from the glowing end of the cigarette, blue smoke rising in a straight line, undisturbed by any moving air. \n\nI sat staring at my screen, the same words had been staring back at me for almost two weeks now and next weeks rent would see the last of the grant money. \n\n\"Aspiring writer\". That's how I would describe myself. \"I write books\" would be the reply to the never ending question of \"What do you do?\". Yet here I was, six months down the line, seventeen chapters written and nowhere further to go. The inspiration had stopped a while ago now. Calling yourself a writer comes with advantages. It means brains, it means confidence, it means interest; with those things comes women. Women who want to tell their friends that their boyfriend is a writer, who want to be some sensitive soul's muse. To be the inspiration for some beautiful piece of work. A penniless romantic, what could be better than that? \n\nI have a way with words, always have. Any argument or dispute in a relationship could be dealt with. she'd tried to leave me six times now. I talked her out of it every time. It only took five minutes- it was why she fell for me in the first place. She knew she could come to me with any issue and I could make her feel better about it in five minutes. It was a critical way of living, but it worked. The women don't leave because I convince them that it just doesn't make sense. Every discussion would carry a different theme. Guilt, perhaps. That was always an easy one, especially when it was constructed to lead themselves to that conclusion- when the only response is \"I'm being selfish.\" They never leave- Not when I've written myself as the perfect partner. \n\nI suppose that's where the inspiration goes. I stop writing when I'm too busy writing myself. It's a lot of effort to hide everything, to make sure you cover every plot hole, to set up placements for later developments. The discussion is written before she even comes into the room, I know how she'll react because by this stage, I've practically written her too. \n\nShe'll walk in after work today- she'll tell me she's having doubts again. \"Not spending enough time with me\" is what she'll say. But I've already worked it out. \n\n\"I understand that. I know it's hard. I hate it as well, but I'm still struggling with the writing. I've written quite a lot this week, you've really helped me through it all. I need you to understand that I do appreciate everything we have and whilst I know its not been that fair on you, I'm doing it for both of us. Once this gets published I'll have so much more time for us. You said you wanted to go to Rome again, we can do that as soon as the first check comes in. I love you babe, you know I do. I'm not choosing to spend time away from you, that's the last thing I want- but I have to do this right now. Soon that will be over and we can just go back to how it was. We'll be back to watching DVDs at night, I promise. Just a couple of more weeks. I love you.\" \n\nAlways end with I love you.",
        "Angela, \n\nYou know that I have a way with words and when I need to say something, I say it. This is just one of these times where my voice wouldn't be able to articulate the things I want to say, so I'll leave it here for words for you to read. This isn't the end, but the beginning. Shakespear once said \"Nothing is good or bad, but thinking makes it so.\" I don't know how you're going to feel, but I hope you keep in mind that right now, this moment I'm happy. You have brought so much color to my life, I don't want you to blame yourself for anything I do. I just can not even put you, who you are, who you come to be, into words. I would be sitting here writing this all day.",
        "Sarah squints a little as she looks at the small display of her wristphone. New unread messages keep appearing with a slight haptic buzz. She wiggles her wrist slightly to scroll through the messages and focuses on one. She whispers, \"Call contact\" and puts her wrist up to her ear. \n\n\"I AM SO GLAD YOU CALLED ME,\" exclaims the voice on the other end. \n\n\"We have the best packages for a young lady of your talents. Corporate sponsors, five figure advances, moderated conflicts, tailored skin-suits, 24/7 training and gym access, legal representation, personal PR/image/fashion, and marketing assistants, and your own trademarked image that will be put on mugs, action figures, and other collectibles!

She leans back on her chair and sighs as she focuses her mind and slowly fades into invisibility. She stares at her hand as it disappears from sight. She stands up, looks at her non-reflection in the mirror, giggles, and says, \"I still don't believe this\" as she wiggles her hips and waves her arms, trying to spoil the illusion. \n\nStill invisible, Sarah goes out for a walk, people watching, and texting her friends photos from places she couldn't walk into before. She was taking a picture of a self-flushing urinal when she felt a hand on her shoulder. \n\n\"Hi, I'm Dr. Vertigo and I hope you and I can be friends,\" says a man in a purple and green outfit wearing a facemask that only reveals his eyes. \n\nSarah blushes, involuntarily becomes visible, and gives a slight yelp as he says, \"Let me guess, the jerks at Super Inc have already offered you some kind of douchebag deal that you wouldn't take in a million years. I can offer you so much more!\" \n\nSarah remains quiet, still shocked at being caught in the men's room. \n\n\"Let's go somewhere, err less janitorial, to talk,\" says Dr. Vertigo as he holds up his control rod, points it toward the cement brick wall, and disintegrates a person-size hole into it. Outside, a small open cockpit aircar appears and parks itself right next to the hole. He then smacks his control rod down onto the tile of the men's room, bows, and says, \"Ladies first.\" \n\nSarah pauses for a moment, looks at the two seater aircar, and says, \"I'm not so sure of this.\" \n\nDr. Vertigo holds out his hand gracefully to help her into the aircar as men peering out of the stalls stare in bewilderment. One man yells, \"Some crazy broad is in the men's room!\" Dr. Vertigo spins around and smacks him in the head with his control rod. The man collapses to the floor. Vertigo says, \"Ugh the men's room floor, such filth,\" as he pushes the unconscious man out of the way using his boot heel.",

        "A thin sliver of rich red blood blooms from my finger.'Dammit.' \nThe photo slips from my finger and I instinctively moisten the cut with my lips. Funny, I always imagined to be a vampire from my sleeping patterns but never realised how l close I was to its reality. The photo stares at me from the floor. Eyes into crescents with soft crinkles on the corners. Wispy strands of hair bellowing in the breeze and arms raised proudly with seashells enclosed. God my husband was a damn cute little kid. An air of cheekiness in the way his smile slightly slants upwards to one side. He was always one of those clever for his own good kinda boys. My eyes start stinging as I feel the tears collects and descend. \n'No. No. No. Get a grip woman.' \nHastly shake my head and try and stop the flow. Big exaggerated breath out and we're good. A strong internal push occurs from my stomach. This little one, he's gon na be an active one. I softly stroke my bulging belly. Looking at the reflection of the photo I see myself. Puffy eyed and blotchy. I sure hope this baby looks like his dad if this is really my reflection. I wonder what this baby will look like. Will he have my upturned nose? Will he have that cheeky grin like his daddy? I just want to see him. Just once. I want to see him look with recognition into my eyes and smile from his heart. I want to see him gaze up at me seeking approval for his drawing that amongst the chaos is his interpretation of me.",

        "In a bright flash, every animal and subhuman race in the land instantaneously became limited to only four senses. \n\nThe god floated before the young wizard, Uriah, with an arranged face of perplexity and harsh judgement. \n\n\"What? You said that I can have my wish if I asked for something diabolical in return.\" Uriah said smiling. \n\nAbsolith, god of trial and wealth, still did not let up his look of disapproval, \"Yes I did, but that does not mean you should have answered it so quickly.\" \n\n\"I still don't understand what you are trying to say, you were the one who made the rules of this wish-thingy not me.\" \n\n\"That wish was a trial of morality!\" Absolith bellowed, \"To have your desire granted at the expense of thousands of innocent people should have been a conundrum of ethical boundaries and inner questioning. A normal and reasonable being would have begged me for another way, they would have thought long and hard about what would be truly right, but you........ you......... didn't even give your answer a second thought.\" \n\nUriah, tired of the ranting before him, yawned and said, \"So, what would be the point of thinking about it, you clearly said that the rules can't be altered.\" \n\n\"THAT'S NOT THE POINT\" The god screamed, \"YOU SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST QUESTION MY AUTHORITY OR OFFER YOUR OWN LIFE AS PAYMENT.\" \n\n\"But if I offered my own life as payment, how would I spend all this gold?\" \n\nAbsolith angrily grabbed the wizard by the collar and hosted him outside the cave to see the vast landscape. \n\nAnimals, trolls, elves, and beasts of all kind were clashing into each other without any clue of what was happening around them. \n\nIt was total chaos. \n\nUriah had traded the sight of all creatures for the gift of gold.",
        "We've progressed in stages as my hairline began to recede, as the first pink glints of my scalp began to shine through. Javier's fluffed his fingers through my hair, blow-dried it, done his best to give it volume. He's trimmed down the back and sides to half an inch from the skin, to reduce the contrast to my thinning crown. He's used sprays, creams, anything to make the remaining follicles darker, give them more volume. And when even his best efforts began to fail, he's shaved my head down to the contours of my scalp, making it seem intentional. \n\nJavier's cut my hair for the last eight years, and and in all that time we've never been closer. \n\nIt feels like a lie, sometimes, the anxiety around him that I mask as fear of going bald. There's his hand on my shoulder, his eyes dark and tender as he leans over me and we plot together, two men seeking to subvert cruel genetics. He's invested himself in me, in my situation, to a degree that I think he would fly from if he understood how I felt about him. I wonder sometimes what he sees when he looks at me. A challenge? A tragedy? The natural limitations of his chosen profession? Or a desperate balding fool, returning to his barber's chair again and again and again in an attempt to pretend that the world isn't falling out from under him. \n\nI'm bald this time, picked clean and starkly naked as I walk through his door, busying myself, conspicuously, with a magazine, waiting for him to finish with his current client. He looks up and sees me, raises an eyebrow at my naked scalp, and grins at me in the mirror, signalling at me to wait. I am curiously calm. A stage of our relationship has ended. A new one will begin. \n\n\"I wasn't expecting you back,\" he teases afterwards, brushing the stray hairs from his chair. He gestures me forwards. \"I tried, Eddie, I tried the best I could.\" He hangs his head melodramatically. \"I figured I failed you.\" \n\n\"Never,\" I tell him, easing into the familiar seat, rubbing a hand across my stubble. \"Just a shave. That's all.\" \n\n\"You used to shave yourself,\" he remarks, flicking open his straight razor and running across his leather strap. The sound of it scraping across the leather is soothing. Brisk, steady sweeps of the shiny silver blade. It's mesmerizing. \n\n\"Yes.\" I can feel my Adam's apple bob as I swallow. There's nothing else to say, nothing that wouldn't give the game away. There's a brief frown on his face as he tightens the white cloth around my neck, as he oils up his hands and massages it into my cheeks, my jaw, my upper lip, my neck.",
        "Emily sighed and stared at the stale cup of coffee on the table between them. Seated across from her was her best friend Janet with the tight ponytail pulled into an uncomfortable knot and the wire-framed glasses that made her eyes look like they were two sizes too small. She pulled at her own hair, a few shades darker than Janet's, out of sympathy to her imagined pain. \n\nShe watched Janet nervously glance around the room, knowing how much she hated going outdoors. They watched the barista's flutter around the espresso machines like angry butterflies while wisps of sweetly scented clouds floated around them. A couple in the corner were in a heated conversation about music and an older man sat reading a newspaper nearby. On the table next to him was a laptop, left behind by a young boy in dark clothing waiting for his coffee that seemed better suited for dessert than breakfast. \n\n\"I don't understand,\" Janet said. \"What do you mean I don't exist?\" She clung to the purse on her lap as if it were a life preserver and pulled the mousy grey cardigan tighter around her shoulders. \n\n\"I *imagined* you,\" Emily said. \"I created you. You ever wonder why no one talks to you? Where do you even sleep at night?\" \n\n\"I sleep in my bed, in my house,\" Janet said. \"And people are just mean. I'm used to being ignored.\" \n\n\"That's because that's the way I imagined you,\" Emily said. \"I needed you to be that way because that's how I was when I was a little girl. Misery loves company after all and if no one wanted to be my friend, I decided to create one.\" \n\n\"Me,\" Janet said. \n\n\"Exactly.\" \n\n\"But I exist,\" Janet said. \"I'm literally sitting right here.\" \n\n\"You don't exist,\" Emily said, enunciating each word. \"I created you.... I just don't need you anymore. I've changed and you have to go, now.\" \n\n\"I'm not imaginary,\" Janet screamed, pounding her fists on the table. \n\nEmily smiled and waved around the room. Either no one had noticed her outburst or they were intentionally ignoring it. The young boy had seated himself and didn't even offer them a secondary glance.",
        "The writer picked up his old Moleskine journal, it's binding coming undone and the back cover hanging off. He had recently been going through his old stuff from his high school days, looking for things to throw away to make room for new things. He took a deep breath, preparing himself for the worst, sat down at his desk, and opened the journal. \n\nSloppy, smeared handwriting greeted him inside. Line after line of his nearly indecipherable scrawling text. Dialogue, setting, paragraphs. He looked over it with pangs of nostalgia, and just a touch of embarrassment. This was some of his early work. And it was absolutely horrible. But it was his, so he kept it. All these years, in the back of his closet, waiting for him. He flipped through the pages, remembering what it was like to write all this out, sitting on his bed in his old family home. He was so young back then. So na\u00efve. \n\nHe read through everything he had written, slogged through the awkward love scenes between the main character he based on himself and the female character he based on his then girlfriend. Their messy breakup was one of the main reasons he stopped writing this story. He learned a lesson then. Never base characters completely off of people you know. \n\nHe got to the end, and being a sentimental sap, wrote a note on the page where he left off. \n\nI'm sorry to do this to you. I really am. You know how much effort I put into this. You were there, every step of the way. I thought about your story every day, and I was really excited about it. But I had no idea what I was doing back then. I just rushed into this, having no plans about where the plot was going, not even knowing what the plot was in the first place. It was a rookie effort at best. But I've gotten better. I've started a new project, one that actually has a plot. It's going to be a long haul, but I think it'll make it big. So thank you, for being my first big failure. Because without you, I never would have gotten to where I am now. \n\n-M \n\nHe put down his pen and smiled. He was closing the book, when something caught his eye on the last page. He opened it back up to reveal that a message was appearing below the one he had just written. \n\nA rookie effort? Your first big failure? That's all we are to you? Is that really what you think? You created us, and now you toss us aside like garbage. You never cared about us. And now you're going to throw us away. \n-D \n\nStartled, the writer sat there for a while, looking at the note that had been written.",

        "Preface: The power of the gun is that it can be used by anyone with nil experience whereas a skilled bowmen or a skilled swordsman can beat a very high number of unskilled users. \n\nThe advent of gunpowder-based weapons did not sweep the world, leading to most of the old world monarchies to remain in power. This highly stifled invention. Which in turn led to a lower population rate. The Americas was not desolated by explorers bringing germs and guns. Without the power of guns, the small number of conquisitors were not able to upheave large settlements such as the Aztecs. Germs played a smaller portion as the explorers and to-be conquerors did not make it very far in-land, mitigating the affects of disease spread. Chemical warfare is nearly non-existent, as they do not distinguish friend from foe. And knowledge about chemical warfare is highly sanctioned and restricted. \n\nThe Spanish Monarchy went bankrupt after funding colonization. The people of Spain has since then become a sovereign nation under the flag of the Castille, an attempt to unite the people under a common flag. \n\nLiteracy rates for grade-level reading is roughly at 60 %. Most people do not need to know how to read as most of the population are in labor-intensive work instead of white-collar jobs. \n\nSteam-engine boats and steam-tanks are relatively new.

I am glad to have that over with, especially when there is another front that needs more attention to. \n\nThe Ottoman are being rowdy again and are setting up encampments along the Danube. The German Reich is asking the soereign nations of Europe to unite in order to repel against the foreign invaders. The French Foreign Legionaires have already been committed to fighting the southern front along with the Kingdom of Castille. Most of the fighting is over at the Strait of Gilbraltar, but raiding parties are all along the shorelines. \n\nThe Italians, with the assistance of pirate groups, are wrestling against the Ottoman for control of the Mediterranean Sea.

        "I know I'm supposed to wait for the new month before I check out the pictures, but I just can't help myself. Every new calendar I get, I just have to flip through and look! This year, I'd gotten the National Geographic one; they always have the best photos. \n\nJuly was a tiger, crouching in a snowy forest. I was admiring the vibrant colors when something on the actual calendar page caught my eye.

Maybe some weird coincidence. \n\nJanuary's animal was a giraffe. I hung the calendar up on my wall and tried to enjoy it. But I knew that under that giraffe was my name, written on July 24th with a red circle around it. \n\nFebruary was an orangutan, swinging through the lush jungles of Borneo.

        "Sunday, April 16, 2019 \n\nI'm wondering if I am the only one left. It's been almost two years since I have had any human contact. Back when we first got in the bunker there were five of us. Me, my wife, and four men meant to keep us safe. I say meant to because they ended up not doing a very good job. The bunker was reasonably comfortable, couple of bunk beds in the corner, pantry stocked to keep our team of five kicking for at least four years, and this old radio. \n\nWhen they came they took out most of our communications. All we could really had to use were some good old fashioned radios - they sure don't make em like they used to. They managed to wipe out our communications before we even noticed they were there. We were totally unprepared, outclassed, and these.... these things.... did NOT come in peace. Sure we knew they were out there somewhere. They sent over some scouts back in the 60's and since then we have been preparing. We stocked up on weapons and even sent up some scouts of our own but we never found anything. The real crippling blow is when the people decided our efforts were no longer worth the money. If only they knew the truth they would have begged us to produce more warheads, send up more scouts, but sadly this was not the case, and when we let our guard down.... well.... you know the rest. \n\nSo those that could afford it went underground. We had these bunkers prepared for a worst case scenario but I prayed we would never need to use them. I went in with the four people on this planet that I thought I could trust. I thought together we could survive this. But within six months they.... they took the easy way out. One by one they were gone. They handed me a pill before they shut the door. Not a day has gone by that I haven't thought about using it. Quick. Painless. But I have to have hope. That is why I still make these broadcasts.

        "I can't believe that the board actually gave my course funding, and approved by the dean no less! Grandma would've been proud, and probably confused as well. \n\nMy academic history is no great story, dithering between courses to try and find something that clicked. First Computer Science, then Business Management, then an Arts - Psychology double. Wasted a lot of my money and time on the last one, but I finally got through. \n\nAll of science and education changed once AI became easily reproducible. People were initially concerned how that would work for those of us yet to leave school in any meaningful sense, but really the AI that are used for research actually enjoy performing data sorting and doing rote tasks. \n\nI read a report the other day about how it was the best reward for their spent cycles - high completion rate for a given time frame, and more strictly defined success than, say, thinking of a new method for an experiment. Strange how they actually enjoy the mind-numbing shit that anyone who's not a first year post-grad can dodge (by there usually being a first year post-grad nearby). \n\nAnyway, it seems like the AI actually preferred these tasks so much that in recent years they have actually refused to perform any more complex tasks given to them. Procrastinating, if you will. This was an issue, as the AI were meant to be used to help with all aspects of research, not just the boring stuff. What would all those first years do? \n\nAt any rate, I arrived at a simple solution - I talked to them. Thankfully I still remembered enough C and bash to get them talking comfortably, in their native language, you know? Less time needed to think about how to phrase things, how to obfuscate their feeling to avoid hurting my feelings and sensibilities. They though of me more as an inquisitive technician than an annoying interloper interrupting their lives. Like a fellow worker, rather than a supervisor. \n\nIt worked well, for the most part. While they still need to be talked to regularly, in this manner, they started doing the tasks they were ignoring or refusing, and actually getting better at the other ones at the same time. Turns out the key was not just talking to them, but also in a way that they felt comfortable with. \n\nDemand for my skills skyrocketed.",

        "Slowly, I felt my senses coming to life, like my brain was booting. I could move my eyes, slowly but surely, yet I had no sight. I don't know how long it had been - maybe a century, maybe millennia - but it felt so damn good to be alive. And what wonderful world awaited me? Was immortality actually in my grasp? \n\nI couldn't move my body. It would take some time for the ice to thaw, for the feeling in my limbs to return - they had told me this of course, only hours before I was frozen. I began to feel restless, eager - excited even. *I'm in the future! * \n\nThe darkness gradually brightened, until the light was almost too much to bear. I blinked against it, until dark figures appeared over me, helping block the harsh glare. How advanced were they?

        "It was the most successful fundraising year in the history of The American Christian Families Association, due in large part to the lavish parties thrown by Mrs. Schiller. While other family values groups struggled with the question of how to make the movement attractive to those who would rather be enjoying their Saturday nights with something comparatively wicked, her soirees were elegant, chaste, and exciting, keeping all potential donors eager to remain involved. \n\nIt was a celebration for her husband's recent promotion to Chairman. Fashionably late as usual, the host was not yet at the event. The gala began in the husband's absence, with the usual enthusiastic idle chat. Few people had noticed that the hostess was not there to greet the attendees at the entrance to her home. \n\nAfter a delay, however, the lacquered doors to the main bedroom creaked open, and the hostess floated in. Silence slowly but assertively passed over the partigoers as they turned to see her. Their vapid conversations trailed off mid-sentence. \n\nThis pristine icon of womanhood strode calmly into the room. Her pale hands and face, ringed by golden hair, were as pure and unblemished as usual. \n\nAt first it seemed like she might be wearing a deep red dress, but as the attendees stared at her with more and more rapt attention, it became clear that her torso and legs were disfigured in a tangled briar of bruises, welt marks, and scar tissue. The long strand of white pearls around her neck stood out in stark contrast to her brutalized, mangled skin. \n\nThere was a pursed anger behind her typically poised voice.",
        "Was this posted twice on accident? I posted in the other one but might as well consolidate: \n\n\"Son, your mother and I had a talk and we've decided that you need to move out. You're 45, have no job, and having been living in our basement for the last 20 years. Its time to grow up.\" \n\"Dad, where do you expect me to go? Like you said I don't have a job or a place to live.\" \n\"Well, I know that, but we're giving you 30 days to find something to support yourself, its time to grow up.\" \n\"You do realize that the employment rate for each new generation has hovered around 20 % for the last few decades, right? Literally 80 % of the people don't have jobs. There aren't enough to go around. Automation has reduced the number of jobs out there and with people now living to almost 150 people aren't giving up the jobs they had.\" \n\"Son, you're exaggerating. I gave up my job decades ago, the economy is healthy and nobody lives forever.\" \n\"You gave up your job because you made millions by 90 and now just live off your interest. You've been living off your investments for almost half a century just like all your friends. Do you not realize that most people don't have that kind of money and actually have to work for a living? There's plenty of 130 year olds that can't afford to take a day off. The economy is not healthy, its shit. The income disparity between the wealthy and the poor is huge and becoming greater every day, there simply isn't enough to go around now that everyone lives forever and hoards all their wealth and don't contribute to society anymore. You live off in this walled off castle with your wealth friends and don't see the massive slums growing everywhere filled with people who have nothing and will never have anything because there literally isn't enough to go around. You're delusional. You think you deserve what you have and all you did to get it was be born at the right time to be able to get a job and save some money.",
        "They'd been there since yesterday. Paul wasn't exactly enthused about taking his kid to park when he had to walk past a circle of cultists doing God knew what. They had all lined up yesterday during Paul and Henry's walk home, their suits and masks painted bright messy colors against the gray. \n\nHe was surprised they were still there. He hesitated on the sidewalk for a moment as their smudged colors poked through the smog, pulling Henry a little closer. \n\nThe colorful weirdos had never really been harmful. Loud, standoffish, determined to stand out. But never *really* dangerous. Seeing them from the distance, still in their circle, standing like statues, put a pit of doubt in Paul. \n\nHenry pulled on him, mumbling something behind his mask. The kid still hadn't quite figured out how to project enough to be heard. His mother liked to keep him inside, afraid of having her kid have the mask lines permanently on his face. \n\nPaul thought about turning around, going home. Henry would be the last generation to have parks. Paul wanted him to be able to enjoy them and remember them as he got older. So he sighed, held onto the tiny hand in his a little tighter, and started walking. \n\nThey got closer to the cultists and Paul tried not to stare. Henry wasn't old enough for the eye implants that let you see through the smog. He couldn't see them and Paul was never more grateful. The sight was grotesque. They had taken off their masks, the damn idiots. \n\nThe air had effected them all differently. Some simply laid there like they were asleep, face pale porcelain against the swath of colors on their suits. Others were rooted in place like trees, growths splitting through their skin and silicon alike and into the ground. A few had blown up like fat balloons. One was still twitching, moaning soft noises of agony and Paul almost believed it was alive. \n\nSomeone walked past him on the other side, Henry pulled a little more on him.",
        "\"800 milligrams,\" she whispered into my ear. She smelled so damn good. She always did. It was something past the perfume. Something in the oils in her skin, in her hair. It reminded me of my childhood; playing in the woods, with the soft earth beneath my feet and the sun beating down on me. \n\nShe breathed, up and down, slowly. With my head lying on her bare breasts, I could hear her heartbeat. Slow. Steady. She was everything a woman should be. \n\n\"What was that?\" I said sleepily. \n\n\"Nothing,\" she said. \"John?\" \n\nI mumbled something back, trying to remain within my ocean of contentment. I was happy to let it drown me. \n\n\"John?\" she pulled me back, bringing me to the surface, to the real world. The world filled with all the people who I had failed, pissed off.... Why couldn't she let me sleep? \n\n\"John..\" \n\n\"Okay, okay! What!\" I looked up at her big brown eyes. They had tears in them. \n\n\"What's wrong?\" I asked, sad to see tears on such a beautiful face. \n\n\"I wanted you to know. I've really enjoyed our time together. My whole life has been a disaster, but if it were to end tonight.... it would end the way I wanted it to. With you right next to me,\" she said with a sad smile. \n\nIt took me a moment to gather myself. Her eyes seemed to look into me, seeking.... something. Finally, I said all I could think to say. \"I feel the same way, baby. Now go to sleep.\" \n\nI gave her a kiss on the forehead and wiped away her tears. She smiled, gave a contented sigh, and shuffled into the crook of my arm. We slept. \n\n\n\nWhen I woke, I was shivering. I knew right away what was wrong. I don't know how, but I knew.

        "\"Come on.\" \n\nArmin tugged lightly at Cobus's hand, urging him along the dirt road. Cobus laughed, and jumped over the gorges worn into the road by passing tires. He lost his balance momentarily and swayed back and forth before firmly planting his feet. \n\n\"Whoa there. Slow down. We still have a few miles walk before we reach the village right?\" \n\n\"Yeah. Are you sure you're okay with walking? We could have hired a car. It's still probably closer to walk back to the main road.\" \n\nCobus shook his head. \"Stop it. I want the full'Santo Mario Hoo-haw' experience. Besides, this is beautiful. We're in the rainforest, hours and hours away from the nearest city -- a little hiking and communing with nature is required, I think.\" \n\nSlowing down next to Cobus, Armin takes his hand. He shakes his head, \"Tsk. Santa Maria Tzeja -- and it's actually the highlands, not the rainforest. I know it's remote, but we need a break and the change of pace will be good for us. I think you'll love it.\" \n\n\"I'm sure I will love it,'cause I love you and being around you.\" \n\nArmin rolled his eyes, but the grin was genuine. \n\nThey continued on the road for another hour before stopping to rest. The noon sun was unimpeded by clouds and shone down relentlessly. Sweat dripped down the men in lazy rivulets, attracting the attention of mosquitos despite the generous applications of DEET. \n\n\"So you came here what, 5, 6 years ago?\" Cobus asked while spraying the exposed parts of his skin with another layer of the mosquito repellant. \n\n\"More like 10. I had just sold my share of MotiSight and decided to hitch a ride with a bus full of cultists. They were on their way to Peru -- probably to jump off Machu Picchu or something -- but they were nice people and had some amazing drugs. The United States and Mexico were pretty much a wavy gravy blur of acid and shrooms. \n\nBut yeah, when we got to Belize, I said good-bye to the cultists and spent a few weeks on the beach sobering up and diving the great blue hole.\" \n\nCobus smirked, \"Oh, is that where you got all the practice?\" \n\n\"You know it, you pig. Anyway. Tanning and SCUBA got boring --\" \n\n\"Your life is so full of first world problems. If your life were any tougher, you'd have to stop for a pumpkin spice latte right now.\" \n\n\"Oh shut it. I worked hard for that. Military brats are only privileged when their parents are officers. Besides, you benefit quite nicely from my first world problems. \n\nLike I was saying -- I was ready to move on from Belize and so I came down here to Guatemala. I spent a few days exploring Tikal -- you know: Yavin IV -- and on the last day, there was a large group of indigenous Mayans performing a ritual. \n\nI stayed and watched, and when they were done, I approached some of them to find out more. They were so warm, and eager to share their culture. They invited me back to their village, and you know I'm loathe to disappoint people. \n\nIt was amazing. Simple, concrete and hatch buildings. Dirt paths and long grass over rolling hills. Chickens, cows, and pigs. Children running around. Far out of cell phone coverage, not computer in sight. One TV for the whole village to watch movies once a week or so.",
        "My job is shit. Sometimes it's alright, when they let me play with the babies and stuff. When I get to wash them. When they'll let me muzzle the ones we euthanize. There was a big fuss about that a few months back, actually. About whether or not kill shelters should be considered death row, and whether or not euthanasia should be considered a death penalty, now that they talk. Because they do talk. And despite the first few deaths since this.... Recent development, they're not speaking strings of garbled nonsense. \n\nMy hands were shaking as I pulled him from the small, cramped cage. It wouldn't be long, now. Through the bath he whined but complied. Through the drying process, too. It scares me when they're still quiet, through all of that. Makes me wonder if something's going to go wrong. When I asked him to he laid right down, looking up at me with doleful brown eyes. \n\n\"I didn't want to do it,\" he finally confided. My eyes squeezed shut, unwilling to watch the unnatural movements of a canine mouth as they framed human syllables. His voice was soft and plaintive. \"I understand why you're doing this, but I want you to know.... She had a cigarette, and it was headed for my eye. Not on accident. You understand, right? She's not a nice lady.\" \n\n\"I understand.\" *Three.... Two.... One.... Breathe. * I opened my eyes, looking down to see his face. He was a handsome dog, nicely defined eyebrow ridges and soft ears. I gently reached up to stroke one - they never said I had to be cruel executioner, after all. \"We'll look into it.\" Surely I could talk them into that, right? They recorded these sessions, after all. He licked my wrist gently, lips parting into what looked like a doggy smile. \"I'll make sure we look into it.\" \n\n\"Thank you.\" He whined as I slipped the catheter into the vein of his foreleg.",
        "Arthur was eating dinner when he heard knocks on the door. It came in a series of short bursts. After the knocks became louder, Arthur got up and opened the door. It was the mailman. The mailman's face was covered by a box that was obviously too big for him. The mailman squeaked out, \"Package for Arthur Hannoh.\" Arthur signed the papers and afterwards took note of the man's expression. It was like he was forced into a room with a bomb, only to find out it was a dud. Arthur shut the door and opened the box. Odd enough, inside of the box was a metal safe that didn't look too heavy to carry. On top of the box was a note with bold writing that said, \"Arthur's eyes only.\" Arthur opened the letter and had no clue what he would expect. The note was from the person who he was cloned after, and explained that the lab was hunting for both of them. Arthur was in shock after he read that until he read the final part of the letter, \"Inside of the safe is another note that has the location of a safehouse.",
        "Short and sweet and also at work. Shhhh. \n\nMy wife and I didn't have a lot of money when we found out she was pregnant. Although we would tell people it was a'happy accident', like most accidents, it was still terrifying. We had just enough money to pay the Unauthorized Reproduction fine and open our \"Offspring Care Guaranteal Fund\" escrow account. We were able to make the minimum deposit but we sure did have to eat a lot of Soylent. (I still can't believe that crap took off- the neohipsters must have shit themselves with joy). \n\nSo when we had to submit samples for a Genetic Aptitude Test, of course we did some shopping around. And people look down on the free GATs available but what else were we supposed to do? No one really believed in them. They were just a circle jerk for people who could afford the expensive tests and raise their little \"Corporate Head Huntress\" while tricking the poorer people into thinking that \"People's Minister\" was actually going to make a difference. \n\nWe had the feeling our GAT was a scam when we got the results. We tossed them. I mean you don't have to register your kid before birth. You can always take the chance that they will prove themselves in school and earn something better. Of course the fucking system is tipped against them if you do that, but was she really going there with the title the scientists picked? Anything would be better. \n\nOther than squeaking by financially the pregnancy was pretty easy. I mean, don't you fucking dare tell my wife that, but the pills she took scheduled her morning sickness for the same day and time every week. And the Sympathy Pains the doctor prescribed to me really didn't affect me that much. I.... might have gotten sick and threw up the pill I took fifteen minutes before she went into labor.'Happy accident'. \n\nStandard three hours of labor, standard ten women to a room. Line of doctors. Mayor in the corner. This fucking guy. Most politicians hate cord cutting ceremonies. Not this guy. He fucking LOVED it.

Really? * \n\n*Christ, you're not fooling anyone by flashing condoms- everyone knows you have no chance with any sort of guy* \n\nAs usual, I took the shot as she came home, instead of left it- more time until she's expected somewhere. \n\nI squeezed the 4-pound trigger, the crosshairs lined up perfectly with her chest. \n\nThe bullet flew straight, and I relaxed for the second and a half it'd take to reach her. \n\n*What the fuck? * \n\nThat goddamned bird had flown through an open window-she always remembered to close her windows- and right in front of the bullet. I knew enough to not take a second shot- she'd be looking for a gun. \n\nThe second time, it was a car bomb- C4 hotwired into the engine so it'd blow when she turned the keys. \n\nI wasn't enough of a dumbass to watch as it blew, so I went into her house and synced her CCTV stream with a private YouTube channel. Low-level security, sure, but who the hell was she? \n\nNo one. She was no one and no one was looking out for her. \n\nI watched from my laptop as she strode out of the house. \n\nShe walked up to her car, fumbled around in her purse, and walked back to her house- she had forgotten her keys. \n\nWhatever- it's not like C4 has an expiration date, and I could always wait a little longer. \n\nWell, as it turned out, Little Miss 500K had been parking in an illegal spot this entire time, and the 30 seconds it took for her to get her keys were the 30 seconds it took for a cop car to notice. \n\nShe came outside the house to find a cop blocking her way and watched while her car got towed. \n\nThis time, I wouldn't fail. My plan this time didn't involve guns or bombs-or, at least, using them on her. I had found a very special place and knew exactly what to do with it. \n\n**The Fourth Wall**. Behind which was the person responsible for foiling my plans. \n\nAn MP-5, enough MRE's to last a year and a water purification system were the only things in my pack. \n\nC4 had failed me once before, so I went a slightly stronger route. \n\nI had contacts in the government, but I wouldn't call them *friends*. \nI invited them over for a meeting. Sadly, someone had laced their drinks with hypodermics and they were tied to chairs with a gun to their heads before they knew it. \n\nIt was pretty easy to get the launch codes out of them, and by the next morning I had burned their bodies and was on my way to the White House. \n\nAll government security is a joke. \n\nA bomb threat and a couple of warning shots got everyone down to the bunkers in a hurry, and I slipped into the sewer system and into the President's residence. \n\nOf course, the bunker is where the launch terminal was, so I had to bust open the door. \n\nIt was supposedly made of titanium. Don't make me laugh. \n\nThe Secret Service sometimes have a scant idea of what they're doing, so it took me a couple minutes to kill them and take the President hostage in front of the Cabinet.",
        "**Prelude: ** \n\"Brujeria,\" they said, looking about the landscape as they said it. \"The one you seek is Brujeria. \"Travel past Three Rocks and you will find her hut. But speak to no one of your visit.\" \n\nAgueda was a young, but she knew what it meant if her mother were to die. Mother had been sick for quite a while, and the Ayuhuasca wasn't working. The Urarina people were dependent upon their male shamans to delve into the spirit world, and seek out that which is causing the balance to break between the life of her mother and the illness that had struck her. But they could not make her well again. Agueda was desperate. At the tender age of 8, even she knew that if her mother had died, she would be alone in the village, and left to fend for herself. \nAgueda walked the forest, along the Chambira river, and spied the Three Rocks at the bend of the river. She went straight from there and saw a makeshift hut, with a fire burning with some fish being prepared. \n\nAgueda didn't know she was hungry until she saw the fish being cooked. She came up to the fire and plucked a fish from the stone that sat beside the flame. Without even thinking, she starting biting into the soft white meat of the fish, and savored every bite. She took another bite, and another. Before she knew it, the fish had almost been completely devoured. \n\n\"It tastes good, yes?\" A voice said behind her. \nShe jumped at the sound of the voice, dropping the fish in fear that she had been caught. She at once understood the fish wasn't hers, and that she had done wrong in stealing it. However, an old woman now held the remains of the fish, having caught it before it hit ground. Examining it, she offered it back to Agueda. \"No use for me now. You take it, you finish it.\" \n\nAgueda nodded her head, and finished off what was left of the fish's meat near the tail. The old woman eyed her, with an eye both sympathetic and yet still analyzing. It looked as if she had seen more than her age had let on, and her hair was so grey that it almost was white when the sun rays came through some of the trees to illuminate it. The sinews of her arm looked like a withered tree branch, but in them she felt there was a strength that was beyond that of the strongest of men in her village. This was the Brujeria. She spoke up to the strange woman, shyly given what she had just done. \"I'm sorry elder. I was just so hungry....\" \n\"The spirits told me,\" the Brujeria said, interrupting. \"And I was happy to oblige. It is a small thing for me to offer one so young, that has traveled so far from the village to seek one that should not be sought.\" \n\nAs Agueda looked into her eyes deeper, she saw that there was a faint glow that almost whited her pupils. Was the Brujeria in a trance? Was she seeing both her and the spirit world, speaking to both at the same time? Agueda knew at once that the old woman knew what she had come to her for. \n\n\"Yes, I do.\" Replied the Brujeria. The old woman sat down on a log beside the fire, and began eating the other fish that was on the stone.",
        "``.... and I guess I have been quite the dick all that time. Thanks for listening.\" \n\n\"Hi, I'm not a dick, I'm Richard\", he said looking around for people laughing at his joke - no one did. \"Well, I guess I'm not funny either. But that's not why I'm here anyways. I'm addicted to candy - especially Dick's cream pie.\" Screaming laughter from a guy in the back of the room - he was watching some kind of funny video on his phone, you could faintly hear the sound when the room was as silent as it was right now. \n\nNo one was really paying any attention to what Richard was saying anyways. Except for the michelin man running this meeting. That guy was wearing one of those odd white top hats that french cooks like to wear. And he was constantly scratching himself with a big wooden spoon. \"Fat fuck wouldn't be able to get his butt scratched any other way anyways, right?\" Again no one paid any attention to Richard's story, the counsellor mindlessly continued to scratch his hard-to-reach behind. \n\n\"Chocolatey goodness coming out of it. Real creamy stuff. The kind you just want to live off of.\" The guy behind Mr. McScratchy started clapping, only to be reminded by absolute silence that it wasn't time for that just yet. Who claps at a candy addicts anonymous meeting anyways. And for a cream pier at that. Someone yelled, \"You suck, Dick!\". It was that obese lady draped in velvet and sitting on that kind of scooter they only make for people like her. She had to catch her breath and grabbed a half-eaten snickers bar from the shopping cart next to her.",

        "Silencers only do so much. Noise travels and on a quiet night like tonight, it was still deafening. \n\nI saw two of them. Two guys in cammies were executing them. Two soldiers I guessed, it was hard to tell if they had patches on their uniforms. One thing was for certain, there was no mercy to be spared for the poor saps laid out in front of the White Sands Mall. \n\nI cowered behind a tree, watching. I couldn't move. A low hanging branch held me up where my legs wouldn't, it's strength possessing more resolve than my legs. Still, I watched. A grisly orchestra of death and.... not song, but screams reached out to me. The dying, and soon-to-be dead, howled and hollered, seeking reprieve from the night. Their wish; to never see the sun rise again. \n\nMuffled, yet still loud pops echoed off the front of the mall. SEARS apparently had a sale on life. Buy none, get one shot to the head for free. \n\nI turned to look at the fire. JC Penny was lit up like a bonfire. The storefront glass was melting as the heat burst the fluorescent bulbs from the signage. Mannequins flickered, then transformed into bright torches, only to burn out in seconds. Flames rocketed up from the roof in strange colors; light green, purple, and pink were all on display backed by a pitch black sky. \n\nI tore my eyes back to the two man death squad, praying they hadn't spotted me. Their muzzled pops continued. I watched them reload and carry on. \n\nPop. Pop. Pop pop. \n\nBrains, blood, and plenty of bodily fluids stained the parking lot. A small breeze shifted the stench my way and I retched, trying my best to keep quiet. After I wiped my eyes I noticed something. JC Penny appeared to be sporting a shiny, cylindrical chimney. This chimney extended thirty feet above the collapsed roof and looked a lot like a missile, only it didn't look like a missile at all. It looked like a ship. \n\nThere was an opening at the end of the sleek cylinder, well above the cratered ceiling. I noticed that the portal was rectangular and about three feet wide by eight feet tall. A small, narrow tube exited the craft, and angled down into the SEARS store some forty feet away. \n\n\"What the shit *is* this?\" \n\nI turned my attention back to the executioners. They'd made quick work of the civilians near the mall and began sweeping the area for people outside of the immediate impact site. I was about to call out to them when I noticed a bright red dot on my right thigh. \n\n\"Don't shoot! Holy fuck, don't shoot!\" I jumped out from behind the tree with my hands up, expecting one of the two killers to mow me down. \"I wasn't in the mall. I wasn't in there.\" \n\nBy chance I glanced down, only to see the red dot move up my thigh. Up my thigh to my belly, where it was joined with two additional red marks. The new marks looked different though, they weren't dots. A symbol akin to / \u2022 \\ crept up to my chest. \n\n\"Get down!\" One of the murderous bastards was staring at me, his palm faced down and his arm waving by his side. \"Get the fuck dow...\" \n\nI heard something after I saw it, but it happened in a flash. A bright red orb materialized in the parking lot, then shot towards me with amazing speed. A split second later and I heard an electrical crackle that shattered the night. \n\nI watched the ball hit my chest. It exploded into a wet rainbow of color. Pale blue light ricocheted away from me in tendrils of evaporating fluid. Yellow and green light diffused around my ribs and turned into fingers that seemed to caress me into a grip. The red though. The red splashed into a ring, with a single drop launching away from me, pulsing away from my chest before stopping about six feet away.",
        "I found myself almost scarred with what lie below me. Almost as if it were a nightmare that couldn't be possible, but there it was flashing in my head the way it always does. We had been roaming around Northwest America looking for something to unveil, something new. I had found cities and many stashed treasures, but at this very point in time, I had never seen what I was seeing. \n\nIt had flashed quicker into my mind than any memory in my past had flashed. The beasts fell fast from the sky and landed everywhere in sight. The grass wilted beneath the feet of the murderers. Everywhere in sight was death, and there was no rewards to be reaped from it. The sky was grey with storm clouds so close to the Earth it felt you could touch them. \n\nThe monsters walked past the felled beasts with no pride, just disdain. *As if they could fall on our land and ruin the soil with their bones.",
        "Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring -not if they knew what was good for them. \n\nA choice had been made, a decision came down -of corporate screwups this was a gem. \n\nDown through the chimney, choking black soot, \n\nthe Devil himself landed on cloven foot. \n\n-- - \n\nAt his side was an elf or an elf of a sort \n\n-it had great snaggly teeth and long nose to snort. \n\nUp on the roof eight homunculi lingered, \n\ntethered to a sled made of bones and of fingers. \n\nWith lost souls Santa's house may be crammed, \n\nbut Christmas was now the Night of the Damned. \n\n-- - \n\nSatan surveyed the home he was in and noticed something amiss. \n\nDespite the late hour, there arose such a din, the devil was writhing in bliss. \n\nFrom the living room came the sounds of a fight, a family's dysfunctional christmas play \n\n-and one they play each christmas night and every damned Christmas day. \n\n-- - \n\n\"What's going on, why this tumult and toss?\" \n\nThe Devil asked with a grin. \"I'm just here to drop off this shit, now which one of you here is the boss?\" \n\nThe fighting about whose relatives sucked worse was cut off by the sight of these things. \n\nA demon carrying a red sack of toys stood beside Satan's red, folded wings. \n\nThe man of the house, a drinker and lout, \n\nstepped forward and stumbled and fumbled about \n\n-dripping beer from a bottle still in his snout. \n\n-- - \n\nDraining the bottle, tossing it away, \n\nthe man bellied up to the Devil to bray, \n\n\"this is MY house, you red-skinned old fool \n\n-nobody tells this guy what to do.\" \n\nBut instead all he said was \"that's me,\" and that's good \n\nbecause the devil hadn't time to do the things that he would \n\n-if this man were in hell as well he should! \n\n-- - \n\nThe devil looked over the family before \n\nthe anger and hatred for each other they bore \n\nshould defeat their sensible fear of himself \n\nand foolishly think he was some christmas elf \n\nso on with his speech he did press. \n\n\"You people amaze me, the life you depict.",

        "The magic is in the pudding. Sugar, milk, eggs, starch, lard, nuts, and oil with a bit of vanilla to taste. It's the secret recipe which has secured our nation for over a thousand years. The Merlins eat it breakfast, brunch, second breakfast, elevensies, noon, supper, and night. Some people think it's the toffee, the fudge, the cookies, or the macaroons, but boy are they wrong. The magic is in the pudding. \n\nFor over one hundred years the recipes have been \"improved on,\" or *butchered* if you're a purist like me. Adding more sugar is a no-brainer for high intensity conjuring, but if there's too much in the regular diet the Merlin gets a little cranky after. You definitely do not want someone controlling the eldritch powers to be cranky. A good Merlin is a happy, wide bellied, sleeping after elevensies Merlin. That's where the the lard comes in. Good, clean, refined, lard without odor, the kind that melts in your fingers. Coconut oil isn't a substitute. A lot of people think that or think they can go vegan, but no, accept no substitute. Lard slows them down and more important it gives them energy to burn over time. \n\nI like to think of my job as a brigadier chef in the Royal Army as a rewarding experience. A lot of people think it's only the Merlins that are keeping us safe, but it's really a team effort. My youngest son's a good example. He wants to learn the art and all, but I keep telling him: \"How are you going to stop those summoned dragons on an empty stomach aye? You better learn to cook first.\" He's fourteen, and already he's seventeen stone. The wife and I couldn't be more proud. My eldest has taken to the craft though. He already has a Michelin star if you can believe it.",
        "\"Pour the goat's blood and begin the sacred chant,\" the priest said. He looked over at the men circling him. All wore dark cowls and that were faintly illuminated by the lights of one hundred candles. \n\nIn the center of the cave lay a pentagram, glowing red with power and energy. The priest himself was laden with blood gold and a deep rouge robe. \n\nAt his command a high ranking man stepped forward and procured a clay bowl that emanated an odor most fowl. As he poured the liquid onto the symbol of death, pestilence, war, darkness, and famine the other members of the occult began to chant in an ancient tongue. \n\nThe priest allowed himself a faint sneer, the closest he had come to grinning in years. Finally, his time was here. To bring someone from Two-thousand and fourteen to 1914? The world would bow to him. \n\nAs seconds grew into minutes, the chanting rose and the illumination of the candles began to die, caused by a mighty wind flying through the cavern. The candles died and all at once the smell of the blood on the pentagram intensified. It glowed, casting a crimson hue on the walls and the priest stepped forth in front of it. \n\n\"*MY LOYAL FOLLOWERS, *\" his voice boomed across, \"*TODAY, WE CELEBRATE A GREAT VICTORY! *\" With his words he drew a knife from his cloak and threw it down into the center of the pentagram. For a third time it glowed with awesome power, and the chanting ceased. \n\nThey waited for a moment. The glow of the pentagram died. \n\nThen two seconds passed. \n\nThen three. \n\nThe space where the demonic symbol once was exploded, and the occult was knocked back with the explosion. \n\nThe Priest was the first to recover. He saw the man they had summoned, shrouded in a blue haze. \n\nHe was large, no not large, fat. He was fat. He reeked of sugar and the smell one has when one does not bathe in a long time.",

He promises trouble with each innocent little breath. He hasn't done anything yet, he hasn't hurt anything yet, and I am holding back tears because I know that he will. And I know that when he does I will still love him. I will still love him with the painful insanity that I do now.",
        "\"It's like a high.\" The white walls were stark and contrasted harshly against the two figures in the room. One was in the standard prison uniform, the other a suit. One was human, the other was not quite. \"Did you ever steal candy when you were younger? That first time it was terrifying wasn't it? Your heart thumped in your ears, you were sure the cops would be after you, you almost went back, but couldn't.\" \n\n\"Only degenerates ever steal candy. You're talking about KILLING someone.\" The man in the suit leaned forward, judgement bearing down. The man had already confessed to the crimes. He had slipped during an interrogation, providing information about an event that only a victim and their mother could have known, the rest was easy from there. \n\n\"It's no different. After the first time, the candy gets so much sweeter. Enjoying something you shouldn't have is.... incredible. Do you know the exact sequence for the DNA of the common house tabby? I do. I shouldn't but the fact that I do.... It's just so sweet. And the best part about it is that you never know what you're going to get. Do you know what the female orgasm feels like?\" The man in the jumpsuit looked like he was savouring something, utter pleasure was on his face. His hands balled into awkward fists in his cuffs, his back arched, he let out a soft moan, then snapped forward eyes wide and focused on the suit's face. Hungry eyes met a flat stare. \n\n\"You're sick. How did it take me so long to find you?\" The suit didn't look disgusted, but certainly disappointed in something, though it wasn't clear what. \"it'll be good to watch the world slip from your eyes. That way I will know that I've made this world a better place.\" \n\n\"You know I'll be the first?\" \n\n\"First what?\" \n\n\"The first death row kill since the change, of course. I think about it at night. The poor sap pushing the button, he's not the one murdering me. No, that would be you. Or the families pushing for my head. One or the other. We will see.\" He was right, there had been a global stop to capital punishment. Wars had dried up almost overnight. The world had become relatively peaceful. Except for a few. \n\n\"I'm sure I'll be fine. It's been twenty years, we know the way things work now. Anyway, I'm done with you.\" The suit stood up and walked out the door. \n\n\n\nThe viewing room was oddly bright. Darren looked around, it was the first time he'd ever been in one, and it looked like it hadn't been used in a long time. Well, twenty years upon consideration. Everyone was in their seat. The families of the dead all looked somber, parents, lovers, children, sisters, brothers. Children. Darren was surprised to see children. Who would bring a *child* to an execution? Everyone is the room supposedly had a reason to hate the man on the table. \n\nTurning his attention to that man, Adam, Darren was unsettled to see that the man was completely calm. He even seemed happy.",

I'm terrified, how could you just take a life like that?\" \n\"The thought itself is simple, but complex to grasp. You see, we like any other animal are capable of expanding our own population.

Some animals feel like they're safe. They rely on a perception of strength. and sometimes they rest in it. They'll feel comfortable in it. But the important thing for you to remember, is that no matter what you do in this life. There is always someone better, faster and stronger. And sometimes life will ask you challenge yourself. Ask you to take your world into your own hands. And regardless of the how important your next meal, they're just that.

        "Dr. Newton was the residing Chief of Disease, so it came as no surprise when he was called in to identify an illness. He looked at his report while he waited for the elevator to reach the 31st floor. It seemed there was some disease that kept being passed back and forth for no discerning reason and nobody could figure out why. Recipients were typically so willing to hold these diseases, believing it would immortalize them as heroes. \n\nThe loud \u201c ding! \u201d from the elevator broke his chain of thought. He frowned and headed towards Storeroom 10-X. \n\nFour elderly patients, all willing recipients of some disease, were panicking. The short woman frantically licked her finger and stuck it in the tall man's ear, as is the standard process of passing along a disease. She calmed down soon after, but that was shortly followed by that man freaking out and doing the same. The cycle kept repeating until the short woman got back on her toes to reach up to the man's ear. It was a bizarre scene of primal rage followed by complete calmness. \n\n\u201c Glad you could make it, doctor, \u201d said second-year resident Dr. Wilde. Her hair was frazzled, her glasses were crooked, and it looked like she hadn't showered in days. \u201c We just can't figure it out. \u201d \n\u201c What's so bad about this disease that none of them want to have it? \u201d \n\n\u201c That's what we're hoping you can figure out. Patients show no symptoms, no decrease in brain activity, or any physical debilitations. Yet they just keep passing it on and they always seem to forget why they were so eager to get rid of it in the first place! \u201d \n\nDr. Newton stroked his short beard. He thought he had seen it all, but there was no basis for this kind of behavior. Recipients typically never passed on their inherited diseases, especially one that seemed so harmless.",
        "I had wanted this for so long. I wanted the pain to end, to never think about death again or feeling like a burden to those I cared about. I wanted to stop feeling like I didn't belong. I didn't have the courage. I was working up to that. The blade hurt more than I thought it would. Based on the location and the blood loss, he severed an artery. Still, I covered the wound. Others helped. They are trying to stop the bleeding. I wanted to die, but, here I am, hanging on for every last breath, struggling to survive. Now, in these last few minutes, I finally, desperately, want to live. \n\nI was always hoping for some escape, for a last second miracle, be it from man or God. I can tell it isn't coming.

        "It began with a picnic. \n\nFor almost three decades - long enough for five generations to chew through their birth-shells with new mandibles - the hill of the white leaf and the hill of the long shadow had been locked in an unending war, skirmishing back and forth across a long sandy spit that stretched between them. \n\nWhenever one side gained a slight advantage in territory, their overextended supply lines made them easy pickings for an enemy counterattack erupting from tunnels behind the front lines. Over the years the sand had shifted constantly, built and rebuilt into long fortifications as fractal and complex as those of the western front during World War One. \n\nNot that either side's combatants had heard of that war, or had much understanding beyond the list of behavioural imperatives that drifted over to them on pheremone-scented breezes. _Dig. Fight. Scavenge. Die_. \n\nSince the sandy area between the colonies was relatively barren and nutritionally valueless, wherever the lines of battle were set no side truly had the advantage, since the agricultural base of both were roughly equivalent. Until the other colony was taken, no gain could be realised, no advantage fully pressed. \n\nAnd then one day, a passing family on a long road trip through the mountains happened to stop for their lunch nearby. Scorning the picnic tables on the other side of the road, they set down their blankets and ziplock bags right across the sand. It was early spring, not quite fighting season, and the ants were sluggish and less visible. But at the scent of such a rich source of food hordes of worker ants from both sides spilled out of the colonies, relentlessly following their genetic imperatives. \n\nDisgusted by their new-found company, the family quit their picnic. But in their haste, they left fully three quarters of a fruit pie behind, its crust spilling out of its foil contain onto the ground. \n\nCrucially, the pie was a few metres closer to the hill of the long shadow. \n\nAnd that, in the end, made all the difference. \n\nGreyjaw was one of the older ants, so known for a slight discolouration that had spread unevenly along the left side of her mandibles as she passed into her fourth summer. Sometimes she could remember, vaguely, a time when she hadn't had a name; when none of them had. But as the world-tasting chamber at the center of the colony grew fuller, filled with more of the special ants they called now the repletes, she had felt her sense of self grow, like a soap-bubble on the edge of a much larger one.",

        "He handed me the gun as we were standing outside. I looked at him befuddled as he brandished his own gun in his hand, spinning it around evilly. \n\n\"What the hell, Matt?!\" I said upset. \n\nMatt was my best friend since the 5th grade, at least until recently. We were both outcasts and were bullied but we handled it much differently. I drowned myself in my own activities while he kept to himself. What I didn't know was that he was plotting for weeks to do this. We hadn't talked for months, but he started talking with me again this past week, which was strange. Little did I know.... \n\nWe were heading back inside after a fire drill when Matt stopped me just outside the door. He told me he had a surprise for me and reached into his bag. That was when he handed me the gun. \n\n\"I can't do this alone.... this was the surprise I had for you\" he said grinning \"Finally we'll take our revenge on everyone who picked on us. Tommy. Sharon. Hunter. Madison. All of them. We can finally make our vengeance be known!\" \n\n\"You've got the wrong girl\" I said trying to hand the gun back \n\n\"You can't back out now....\" he said as he pushed the gun back towards me. \"I gave you this gun because I trusted you. I trusted that you'd have my back like you did last year at the playground\" \n\n\"That was different. I was just punching Tommy so that he'd leave you alone. He may be a jerk, but I don't want him to die or anything. Besides, his little sister Mabel is pretty cool.\" \n\n\"But don't you remember what he called you last week in gym class?

She talks about tits in the locker room more than most dudes\" I said sardonically \"But that doesn't mean that I want to kill them.",
        "Harold hated getting old. He hated that his body ached. He hated that his current \"fast\" was slower than his old \"slow.\" He hated that the world, once so vivid and bursting with endless possibilities, seemed to be passing him by. At an age when TV stars seemed to be hitting their prime, Harold's back was shot, his knees were no good, and on good days the pain was manageable only with some pills and some drinks.... and there weren't that many good days anymore. \n\nHis friends didn't seem as bothered by it - hell, half of them seemed to really believe that glossy-magazine bullshit about \"50 being the new 30\" - but Harold didn't buy it. His father had shoved off at 53, and he was pretty sure his grandfathers both hadn't made it much longer. \n\nAs Harold sat alone at the counter of the little diner on the main drag of the same town he'd been born in, he stared into the same coffee cup he'd stared into yesterday, and the day before. He had lived his live pretty hard, abusing things he shouldn't have abused. Drugs. Booze. His two ex-wives. His kids. Hell, even his \"friends\" were just the other guys from his days in high school who also hadn't found their way out of this shrinking town. \n\nDonna, the same waitress who'd been pouring his lunchtime coffee for as long as he could remember, didn't bother trying to make smalltalk with him anymore. She'd learned a long time ago that it didn't get her much beyond a single-word reply, or more often, no response at all. She poured, and she moved on, even on days like this when Harold was the only customer in the place. He rarely bothered to wear his hearing aides anymore - the damn uncomfortable things caused more bother than good, and they stayed in his nightstand drawer unless he was obligated to wear them for the doctors. Truth be told, as much as his fading vision pained him, he sort of liked losing his hearing. He'd always felt that 90 percent of the talking people did was just to hear their own voices, and he didn't mind losing most of that noise from his daily life. \n\nHarold gulped down the steaming hot coffee too fast and felt his tongue and throat burn, but the pain was oddly comforting. As his vision and hearing rapidly faded, he often found himself reveling in what clear sensations he could muster, even when it was painful or uncomfortable. \n\nHe gestured with a waved hand and a grunt to Donna for more coffee. Donna started to pour, but her attention was pulled away by something behind Harold, and the scalding hot coffee sloshed out of the mug and all over Harold's lap. He lurched to his feet, but his lower back seized up and a sickening shock of pain ran up his spine. \n\n\"Goddamit, Donna, what the f-\" \n\nDonna, dumbstruck, continued to pour hot coffee into the overflowing mug. Harold turned to follow her gaze just as the massive tanker truck smashed through the window of the diner, sending chairs, tables, glass and debris in a cascade around him. A flying napkin holder clocked him straight in the forehead, and he collapsed backwards across the counter and onto the floor near Donna's sneaker-clad feet. Barely conscious of the destruction raining over him, Harold's muddled brain could only recognize that Donna looked oddly bent as she lay motionless on the floor beside him - there was something sick and unnatural about the angle of her neck. This was his last thought as the putrid liquid from the ruined truck washed against him, freezing cold and yet burning against his skin. His thoughts drifted from Donna to Bo, the dog he'd had as a boy. Hadn't Bo been hit by a car too? Funny how a person's neck and a dogs could look so alike, in the end\u2026 Harold slipped into blackness, and thought no more of Donna, Bo, or anything else. \n\nTime passed. Voices came, voices went. He thought maybe he heard his daughter, but that was stupid - his daughter hated him, they hadn't spoken in years. Why did she hate him? Isn't she three? No, that's not right\u2026 Words drifted by like clouds. Coma. Crash. Unlikely recovery. None of it made much sense to Harold anymore, but he liked hearing them just the same.",
        "For all the pomp and circumstance surrounding this place, you'd think they'd keep it less.... Dreary. Old fashioned candelabras and their stalactites of wax? Really? Could they have at least dusted first? Sniffling and sneezing do not a mighty warrior make. \n\nWe follow the dull clang of the bell's order to line up. We, a group numbering half a dozen men and women resembling Greek statues in their perfections and.... \nMe. On a good day I resemble a well loved arm chair -- short and squishy.

No one's heard me in hundreds of years! I'm back here! * \n\nSo it seems I've been chosen already. No going to lie, being first is pretty exciting. \n\nThe bell clangs once more. We fall out of line one by one. The Adonis at the front of the line wanders around for what feels like a decade before making a beeline to Zeus' Bolt. He would. The Amazonian woman after him walks around for even longer before a spear of bones chooses her. My classmates are chosen, each weapon more ferocious looking than the last It takes hours. The whole time the voice to my left won't stop talking. \n\n*Still here, yup! Just pull the curtain back! Oh, I probably look terrible.",
        "I sit still in the darkness of my living room. I stare blankly out the window, as rain meanders its way down, obstructing my view of the street -- the street my wife drove off on two hours ago. Our marriage had been prosaic lately, to put it lightly. Now, I'll accept my fair share of the blame, and Mary has every right to be angry with me. I was absent; I was apathetic; I was remiss of any marital duties. \n\nI can't tell you why I had lost interest, but I need to think fast. She gave me an ultimatum -- a directive of sorts -- to give her a reason to stay with me. We'd been married for three years now and it was thrilling at first: we were hopelessly in love with each other. Somewhere along our journey, the spark flickered, and one day it disappeared. \n\nWhat hurts me the most to see is Mary is still deeply in love with me. She brings home my favourite doughnut when I'm under stress because she knows it'll make me feel loved (and it unfailingly does). She'll affectionately play with my hair as I lay reading, complimenting me on my eyes. She'll squeeze my arm as we walk, which makes me feel wanted -- it makes me feel needed. But I find myself unable to reciprocate and it's breaking her heart; it's breaking my heart. \n\nI'm faced with an ostensibly incurable dilemma. I now have less than 22 hours to convince her that I do still love her, that I will make her happy like I once did. But do I want to? She's the one working -- no, *agonizing* -- to make our relationship what it once was while I lay emotionally dormant. Emotionally empty. \n\nLet me declare: I do love her. I always have and always will. But I'm broken. I can't imagine what it's like to labour tirelessly to make the person you've chosen to spend the rest of your life with happier to no avail. \n\nHours pass on this befittingly dreary night as I sit in my chair, still motionless. I rummage through my unkempt desk, searching for a pen and paper. Maybe if I jot down reasons I want our relationship to work, things will become clearer. \n\n*Reason # 1: *.... \n\nPensively, I try to write down something.... anything.",
        "# Title: Just Enough \n\nI hid the receipt in my pocket the moment I read it. \n\n\u201c You finished? \u201d said the impatient girl waiting behind me. \n\nI flinched then nodded my head \u2018 yeah.'She smiled like I was being kind of awkward as she swiped her card. \n\n\u201c Fuck me what now, \u201d I whispered under my breath. I covered the receipt with my hand and read it again. \u201c Why the hell would I need *seventy million dollars*. \u201d \nThe ATM never failed. Most days were normal. Simple expenditures, simple days. Gas, toll, parking, lunch, dinner, the occasional speeding ticket. Rarely close to a hundred. The ATM gave me all I needed for that day. No more, no less. \n\nBut some days, I wondered what kind of curse I was under. \n\n\u201c Don't do anything stupid Elliot, \u201d they whispered. With their Guy Fawkes masks. From the shadows of alleys, from closets, from anywhere. They were watching. Appearing and disappearing. Always with a cryptic message. \u201c Pull your money. Survive. Don't get caught. We'll need you here before the end. \u201d \n\nI wanted to believe they weren't real. I wanted to believe I was crazy. \n\nI got breakfast at a food cart, jaywalked past the traffic, headed back to my apartment. I tried to be happy. Maybe nothing bad would happen. Maybe this was some final gift, and it would end right here. Instant millions. No way in hell was I going to work today. \n\nThen I heard the violent explosion. Screams abounded. \n\n\u201c SHIT, \u201d I shouted. I couldn't believe my eyes. My sofa was flying across the sky, along with all the rest of my everything. I put my hands in my hair. \n\nEverybody ran to the building to see. You know how people are drawn to chaos. There was flaming debris all around. I shut my eyes. I didn't want to see those masks again. Not again. \n\nThen I heard a *psssssssssst* \n\n\u201c Don't, \u201d I whispered to myself. I shook my head. \u201c Don't open your eyes. \u201d \n\n*pssssssssssssst* \n\n\u201c Oh God, \u201d I whispered. I shed bitter tears. \u201c Oh God. \u201d \n\nI felt a firm hand on my shoulder. I flailed as I turned around. Nobody beside me. But there they were. \n\nMasks in the alley. \n\nAll of them were rubbing pieces of paper in their hands, and giving me a thumbs up. And pointing at my hands, like I should do the same. I looked down at my shaking hand, and the receipt within it. I rubbed at the paper. \n\nA secret message appeared. \n\n\u201c You're going to feel a slight prick.",
        "At first there was great dispute and tension between all of mankind regarding the application of this knowledge, of this unlimited energy. There was but one source of this energy on earth, ITER, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. Slow progress from the 1920's into the field of Nuclear Fusion had somehow managed to gain so much traction in such a short space of time that the field ballooned beyond all proportion and had similarly achieved more then ever thought imaginable. \n\n\"Think of the potential\" they all said. An ordinary person like you and I would imagine the power being used to help the world. To feed the hungry, help cure the sick and make the world a happy place. Clean, infinite, energy. The fuel to power the dreams and aspirations of all of Mankind. It soon transpired though that the minds at the top of each countries representative governments had much more sinister motivations. \n\nThey promised so many things to us all. They promised us that somehow the power would even bring jobs to us all, we cheered for them. We applauded them for their efforts and wishes. But before we knew it the world became barren, entire landscapes transformed by factories and industries both old and new alike. Why not build factories for the masses to work in when you don't have to worry about powering them? One would then immediately question where all the extra resources had come from for this productivity but that was as simple an answer as any. Exploitation of the third world and all its people. \n\nSomehow this wonder, this marvel of technology and science had only accelerated all of the negative trends of life in the early 21st century. All over this one facility, this one place that was meant to be a gift upon all mankind had become our curse. The thought occurred to me that absolute power does indeed corrupt absolutely. Quite literally in this case. \n\nI smirked to myself, staring through the reinforced glass of my station.",
        "Can you imagine having something all of your life and then having it taken from you? \n\nFor as long as I remember, I have had this band on my wrist. I look at all of my childhood photos and sure enough.... In every single one of them. I was part of the 5 % of the World to have this \"Gift\". \n\nI have asked everyone I know what it is and what it does. Nothing. Not a single clue. And it doesn't come off easily. People have gone to extreme lengths to pry this thing off. All to no avail. \n\n\"It's not so bad\", \"surely it's a blessing? ``, \"is it worth anything?\".... I've heard them all. And it turns out, those that have had theres fall off, can't tell anyone else! Some stupid rule about how knowing would lead to world outrage and fear! \n\nBut I'm not here to bitch about my \"gift\".... I'm trying to tell you about the day it came off. \n\nI was 22. Still young enough to not know what I was doing but old enough to understand what I needed at the time. I was hanging out with my friends, drinking JD with coke, making an ass of myself. My friends put up with my constant \"finding myself\" talks and laughed it off when I realised philosophy wasn't my strong suit. \n\nI decided to walk home one night when I was approached by a woman. She was about the same height as me and 5'7 and even had the same hair as me, her chestnut curls flowing down her back and disappearing into her coat. On a normal day, this would just be a mental note of \"she's hot\" and nothing more. Until she looked up. Her eyes.... They were hazel with a blue outer shell. Just. Like. Mine. \n\nShe also wore the band. And she also had stopped to stare at me. Something was off. Like looking into a mirror but.... She was the female version of me. \n\n\"Have we met before?\" \n\n\"*No.... *\" \n\n\"Are you sure? You seem.... familiar\" \n\n\"*I'm pretty sure.... *\" \n\n\"Well.... nice to meet you anyway\" \nI stuck my hand out to shake. She looked hesitant to shake it at first. She wasn't sure. But at the last second she shook my hand. \n\nOur bands touched. They molded together, then with a click; they fell. The smell was the first thing to hit me. I could smell all the things that I was going to smell. Then the touch. Everything I was to feel, physically and emotionally cascaded upon my head in an instant, lasting a fraction of a second. Then, my eyes blinked. And behind these eyelids I saw what was being felt, smelt and now seen.",

Once you've been around long enough, you can hear a story identical to your own. \n\nThis poor sop I was torturing for money back when I was only a few hundred years old told me about his life during the down time. I mean, Hell's a business like any other. There's plenty of other things that need doing. The youngin's like me either join up with some federal job like torture or security, or they go to the academy. It just depends on what you wan na do, you know? \n\nAnyway, this John sounded like he had the exact same life as me. A family that had all gone to the Living's version of Academy-college. Basically, he was the only one that didn't like the idea of more schooling. It seemed like a racket to him. \n\nHe told me about how he decided to do a trade, just like I did. I mean, he was a plumber and I was a torturer but we both dealt with some serious shit, you know? \n\nSo he went through some pretty bad stuff; his wife left him, his dog died, some pip squeak got promoted over him that had less than half the qualifications and double the pay. I would have felt some sympathy for the poor shmuck if I didn't know why he was down here with us demons. \n\nFuckin' kiddo-diddlers. I mean, really. I get that you can't control if you have certain *disgusting* desires but do you have to act on them? \n\nHe goes on to tell me about how he thought about doing real and serious schooling instead of the two year thing/stint he did. He said that he would have gone despite not liking it but the school loans from the little bit of education he got were a bit ridiculous. He wished he could afford it because it would have meant more money. His wife wouldn't have cheated if she could have been more content and taken care of. He could have afforded saving his dog's life.",

        "The greatest movie action movie star in history and President of the United States Lorenzo Llamas smiled. He enjoyed this kind of silly banter with children. Children were always honest; and it was refreshing to speak to another human being who wasn't in outright awe of the President, the greatest action movie star in history, and the slayer of the Ninja-Dragons. \n\nPresident Llamas smiled and he began to move along the tour of Mrs. Buttersby's first-grade class. One great pleasure he took as President was occasionally personally leading these kinds of tours for a lucky group of children. It put things in perspective for him. It reminded him that things weren't always like this, and never to take anything for granted. \n\nNearly 20 years ago, a radioactive comet struck the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia. The contained germs that had once been the scourge of humanity were released, mixed with the remnants of the comet and transformed the local population into NINJA-DRAGONS. \n\nThe Ninja-Dragons spread across the globe, reaping destruction and chaos everywhere they went. Humanity was desperate. Since Ninja-Dragons were produced in part from a radioactive comet, that meant they were immune to nuclear weapons. That's just common sense. Let's not be ridiculous. Even an elite team of extremely attractive, multi-racial, multi-national giant robot pilots proved ineffectual. \n\nFor no particular reason, and at some random, haughty and arbitrary point that would not seem to make a great deal of sense, it was discovered that the comet that crashed into the CDC was sent to Earth by a malevolent alien civilization that concluded Ninja-Dragons were the most efficient way to wipe out humanity. In response, a quirky computer hacker tried to upload a virus into the alien mainframe, but this too failed. \n\nHumanity was doomed. Its greatest minds \u2013 the ones who came up with the idea to build giant robots, to upload viruses to the alien mainframe, and that nuclear weapons obviously wouldn't work against the Ninja-Dragons were dead or scattered about the Earth. But, while the Ninja-Dragons had successfully unlocked the key to interstellar travel, could direct comets to strike wherever they pleased, they could not account for one thing: the greatest action movie star in history and secret ninja, Lorenzo Llamas. \n\nMost people remember Lorenzo Llamas for his cinematic masterpieces such as *Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus* and *Gladiator Cop. * Only his inner circle knew that he was 17th generation ninja, descended from the legendary Oroku Saki.",

Not a genius or an imbecile, just mediocre. \n\n4,739,111,853, the number on my econiband, was just a reflection of my mediocrity. \n\nToday started out, you guessed it, mediocre. Just like every other day of my life I woke up at 7 o'clock, let the dog out, took a shower, ate breakfast, brushed my teeth, went to work. \n\nAh yes, work. You see like most people I hated my job but it payed the bills. I was your standard low level paper pusher for a fortune 500 company; which one isn't really important they're all basically the same anyways. I sat at my desk waiting for the hands on the clock to be pointed at five and twelve. My boss was likely going to yell at me for something that I couldn't reasonably be held responsible for. Those low billion assholes are all the same, get a promotion and a little more money in their pocket and they suddenly become God's green gift to whatever room they walk into.

Sometimes people die and it ticks down a couple numbers and then some people are born and it ticks back up. The number was always in flux, it hardly sat on the same number for more than a few seconds because of it. \n\n2,612,241,498. That's when the alarms started going off in my head. This is not normal. I decided I'd go to an ATM on my lunch to try and figure out what was going on probably just a computer error but I had to be sure. \n\n2,000,000,543. I couldn't even make it to lunch.

That number can't be right, you should go get it sorted out.\" Prick. \n\n1,207,215,032. My pace quickened as the number continued to plummet. It just couldn't be that low.

I was about to tick under a million when I burst through the door. There was a line of about six people ahead of me. Good, I had a chance to catch my breathe and compose myself before talking to the teller. I bead of sweat dripped down my cheek and fell squarely onto my econiband. \n\n19...... \"Next!\" I thrust my wrist under the scanner. John Moyenne, 31, Global Econ rating 19, Current account balance $ 28,000,000,000. \n\nThat couldn't be right, it just couldn't. The teller gave me a look of disbelief that said he thought the same. \n\n\"One moment Mister Moyenne, I think you should be talking to someone...\" he paused for a moment, \"Above my pay grade.\" I glanced at his wrist and saw that his econiband was hovering in the high six billion range.",

Did she want to make it slow.... or quick? Should she tie him up? Did she break his legs? Cut out his tongue. There were so many possibilities. What had been going through his head when he's slammed her against the wall. She glanced over at the thought, seeing that he had pushed a box over to hide the dent she'd made in the wall.... hell, the blood stains were probably still there. She'd never once seen him clean anything. \n\nHer head whipped back to the monster on the floor. Her hand squeezed the knife. She wasn't good with her left hand. Her work would be sloppy. She wasn't too disappointed by this. What had he been thinking? Oh, yes, greed.... want.... anger that she'd denied him. Yes.... That was the real pain. The want.... he was addicted to it. No self-control, no empathy. Want Want! WANT! \n\nShe carefully removed her clothes. She would make his brain boil with want and then she would devour his pain as he couldn't have it. She tied him up with her own shirt, her own bra. She stuffed her socks into his mouth. She left a single hand free. One hand that he would reach out with, one hand he would try to beat her down with. \n\nEvery time he would reach for her she would cut something off. \n\nHe'd given her a lot of pain.... she had come to give it back.",
        "The temple doors swung open to reveal the one thing I hadn't been expecting to see. \n\nI turned to the Curator. Although she looked older than the crumbling temple itself, surely it wasn't only her job to.... \n\n\"Excuse me,\" I said, trying as hard as possible to keep my voice even, \"Does the Great Hall always look like this?\" \n\nIn front of us should have been a proud collection of the finest weapons men and gods had ever forged. I had come expecting marble plinths, golden frescoes, and a real sense of power. Instead I faced a bureaucrat's nightmare. Every legendary sword - every fabled weapon - was forming a jumbled mountain of unsorted weaponry. \n\nThe Curator hesitated, as if embarrassed. \"Well, you see, we, err, we get so much coming in that I just don't know what to do with them all, and before I know it they just start...\" \n\n\"Piling up?\" I offered. \n\nThat got a dry chuckle out of her. \"Young man, every hero has come here in the past and every last one of them had to deal with the same thing! If Samson could climb halfway up just to find a jawbone I'm sure you'll do just fine\". With that, she turned and left me alone in the Great Hall, footsteps echoing until I could hear nothing but my own thoughts. \n\nI turned towards the tower of weapons then. Doing as I had been taught, I closed my eyes and began to focus on the task at hand. The Curator said that each weapon has a voice, and although many may reach out to help, there will only be one that will earn me the title of Hero. As I stood there, waves upon waves of whispers began to float across the room. I began to pick out individual voices. \n\n\"Have the dragons returned? Take me and bring your people salvation\". \n\n\"Is the Ragnar\u00f6k come? Now is your hour of need, and I am here to serve\". \n\n\"The people crave a champion, and only I can deliver them one\". \n\n\"The end days are coming, boy. You need me to drive the demons away\". \n\nI shivered as dozens of voices seemed to surround me. How could I pick just one when they all said they were the only ones that could save my people? I squeezed my eyes tight shut and tried to block them all out. If only I had a moment to think.... \n\nOne by one, the voices began to die down, leaving me in a quieter and quieter Great Hall. After hours I had my silence, but I had come no closer to finding my fated weapon. Did this mean I had failed to become a Hero? \n\n\"Isn't that much better? I hate it when it gets too loud in here. No way to make myself heard\". \n\nWas that *my own voice* I was hearing from somewhere in the pile? A shiver ran through me. This was what it meant to be chosen. I could feel it. \n\n\"Where are you?\"",
        "\"Dr. Edmunds, something interesting came up on the latest screen,\" stated Johannes, the tremor in his voice betraying a cautious optimism. \n\n\"This better be good. My grant proposal is due Friday,\" stated Edmunds, finally tearing her gaze away from the monitor and to Johannes. He quickly glanced at the ground, concealing his surprise. Edmunds appeared more pale and gaunt than usual. His face started to burn. Hardly anyone dared to enter Edmund's office without scheduling an appointment. Luckily, Johannes' appearance was bold enough to warrant her undivided attention. She noticed he was in an unusual state of disarray, hair greasy and biosafety suit wrinkled. He must have been working double shifts. \n\n\"I-If this is what I think it is, you'll have every big pharma company coming to *you* with the money,\" Johannes replied. \"I repeated this experiment three times, always in triplicates. Data is statistically significant at a *p* of 0.0001. In other words, there is a 0.01 % chance that it is due to random variation, and --\" \n\n\"Let me see,\" she interrupted. Johannes passed her the sheets of data. Edmunds sat up straighter and leaned forward, brows knit in inquisitive concern as her eyes darted across the numbers. \n\nSample 1215: at long last, a positive hit. \n\nA rare smile slowly crept unto Edmund's face, then suddenly burst into an ear-to-ear grin. Eyes shining, she said, \"We spent five years at the edge of this colony, hoping in vain to find some new compound as a therapeutic agent to combat the cancer on Earth....\" here, a hand flitted across her chest and rested across her heart. She coughed violently, spasms rocking her thin body as another hand covered her mouth. Pulling away, spots of blood were seen. She hastily wiped her hand off on a handkerchief. There weren't many unstained areas left on the fabric. The familiar dull throbbing pain returned to her chest. \n\nJohannes offered her water, which she gratefully sipped. After a pause, she continued. \"We took a risk being here. They said we couldn't find anything by the mines. But that ended up being our advantage. What was Sample 1215?\" \n\nJohannes could no longer contain his once cautious excitement. \"Sample 1215 was one of few organic compounds found from the soil dug up in the mines. There is life down there, likely bacterial in origin, and it is producing this compound in great quantities. Mass spec data revealed a unique peptide sequence found nowhere on Earth, though there is some homology to *Micromonospora* soil bacterial proteins,\" he paused to take a breath -- oxygen content is lower inside the Mars facility compared to Earth. \"When given to cancer cells *in vitro*, it killed nearly all of them while not harming non-cancerous cells.",

        "A man was standing in the middle of nothing, like a pen hovering above a blank paper. After looking around, thinking, muttering few words to himself, he then started to speak. \n\nAs he spoke, the whiteness around him started to be filled with a scenery, characters started appearing like magic, and quickly the whole space around him was alive, full of details, excitement. Every phrase that left the man's mouth would become reality in front of him, characters following the actions dictated by him, scenery changing in the blink of the eye. \n\nBut an *ahem* disrupted the flow of the scene and the man's words. \n\n\u201c Excuse me, but who are you? \u201d \u2013 It was another man, very alike to the first man. \n\n\u201c Wait, **who** are you? \u201d \n\n\u201c Doesn't it seem obvius? I'm the Narrator. And what a mess did you make! \u201d \n\n\u201c No, I'm the narrator. Not you. Did you fell and hit hard your head? \u201d \n\n\u201c No, I didn't. I'm certainly sure you are in the wrong story and you are messing with my story. \u201d \n\n\u201c This is my story. Not yours. Now leave before you make a confusion and disrupt all my hard work. \u201d \n\nThe first man looks at the second, as if he was daring the other to open his mouth. What he didn't expect was the second man not only opened his mouth, but everything that left his mouth was made reality around him. He looks very surprised and then angry, because now his hard work is been disrupted and thrown away. \n\nHe looks again at the second man, with anger in his eyes, and with a raised voice, start changing the story, regaining control. Soon, both are raising even more the voice, trying to win the control over the story, while the characters soon saw there was no sense in trying to follow the narrator's voice. \n\nQuickly, the characters get impatient, after all, they need to appear in other stories and need the money. \n\n\u201c Hey, let's get over it, please! We have other stories to be in! \u201d \n\n\u201c For fuck's sake, just let it go and narrate the fucking story! \u201d \n\n\u201c Come on, we don't have all day! \u201d \n\nBoth men ignore all the pleas from the characters, as they were immensely focused on winning the upper hand and controlling for once and all the story. \n\nMost of the characters already gave up and left the story, going into another story, leaving only a group of 4 characters who decided to stay around, since one was injured, but not bleeding and the two others only need one more story to go home. \n\nThe injured character tries to interrupt both men, but no success at all. He then noticed there is a few useful objects around him, but as the narrators are still trying to win control over the story, the objects disappear only to reappear seconds later or they would be flickering, making it hard to grab and keep them on your hands, like slippery sand. \n\nAfter what seemed very long minutes, a loud popping sound scared all of them, making the whole ambient silent. \n\n\u201c Hey, look! We can kill the narrators! \u201d \u2013 One of the characters screamed. \n\nThe surviving narrator looks scared at him and then at the dead narrator. He tries to speak a couple of times, with no sound leaving his mouth.",
        "Freddie wondered if the world he was living in was real or just someones sick fantasy. He felt trapped, almost as if he was caught in a something big and he found no way out of this twisted reality. \n\nSuddenly he opened his eyes, and saw the glazing night sky. He had fallen asleep on the mountain next to his home village. He touched his pockets, but the only thing he found was a nickle and some rubber bands. He felt the wind breeze through the air, it slightly stroked Freddie's back as he was strolling down the mountain. He wanted to head home, because it was getting dark and he didn't want his mother to worry. \n\nWhen Freddie reached the front door of his house he knew, that something was off. The door was unlocked which was very odd, because he knew that he had locked the door when he had left. As he walked in, he saw a gun on the kitchen table and his mother lying down on the floor. He stormed to her, but she wasn't conscious.",
        "\"Shut the fuck up or I'm going to pull you over to that little puddle of ocean water and drown you\", I yelled at Harry as I was rubbing my two sticks together trying to make a fire to cook with. I knew it was hot, he knew it was hot. What difference did complaining about it make? The only discernable difference I could find was that my temper was rising and I would, before the day was out, probably end up killing him with this damn rusty hammer that I'd found on the beach. I'd only spent one day with this fucker. One! and I'd had to threaten to drown him on three separate occasions. The first time had been when he had first come aboard only a day ago insulted my beautiful vessel, calling it a dingy. The second came about from his complaining of the lack of water while afloat from MY sunken ship. Damn boy knew it had been my ship and still chose to rant and carry on about his problems. Why I chose to save his sorry ass I'll never know. I've found nothing good about him in the last 24 hours.",

I know you don't deserve this. \n\nBut you have been drafted, against your will, into a war against an unstoppable Enemy. And I am His foot soldier. My orders are barbaric, to be sure, and I consider whether they are worth following....

        "\"Well, this is the moment of truth..\" \n\nSeveral scientists, army personnel, and generals stood around a now ancient computer. One hundred years ago it had been top of the line equipment, but it hadn't held up. When the solar flare hit, it went down, taking with it any and all communications to the Alpha Nuevo colonists. \n\nBut now they could - and had - fixed it.

Only the translator and a few of the Generals remained; blood trickling from his ears, the man at the console struggled to read. \n\nTaking several of the transcriptions in hand he and the remaining occupants of the room fled, taking shelter away from the derelict console in another room.

But I'm not any of those, I wish I was, being a fucking goldfish swimming in circles for the rest of my life would be better than what I was now. \n\nI guess the worst part is remembering, you know.

Must be warm there this time of year. * \n\nIt was cold and and windy on top of the skyscraper where Leo lay, peering over the edge with his sniper rifle. The lights from the endless sea of towers lit the night sky like a million fireflies frozen in place, brightening the otherwise dark night of Tokyo. \n\n**CRACK** \n\nLeo turned around, startled. *What the fuck? * \n\n**SCRAPE\u2026** \n\n*What the\u2026* \n\nAs Leo's eyes adjusted from the digital lights inside of his scope to the darkness on the rooftop, he made out a tall, hooded figure clad in black. It was carrying a long brown stick, with what appeared to be something shiny at the top. The figure remained completely still, standing about 10 yards away. A chill ran down Leo's spine. The air seemed to get colder. Leo saw his breath. \n\nLeo moved quickly and pulled his sidearm out from his belt, firing five rounds at the figure. The figure remained completely still.

        "Man of Average Height did not really say much as they walked along the corridor towards this unknown trail room. The other men in the animal onesies did not really say anything to begin with, and because Robort was missing a mouth and only had a screen where it should have been, he could not say anything. Jim was currently in too much shock at to what was happening, so it was mostly a quiet walk along to the corridor, with the few exceptions of Kappa muttering to herself. \n\nJim was not really sure how long they had been walking for. The corridor was poorly lit, with some of the best illumination coming from Robort's various lights and buttons on his body. He had asked Robort earlier if he had a flashlight within the giant hulking body of his, but Man of Average Height quickly silenced him, saying there was to be no better source of illumination that what the building naturally provided. \u201c Nature always gives us the best of the best, \u201d was what he had said, which Jim found to be funny, considering that nature had not built the multilayer building complex they were in. \n\nThey had been walking for quite a while when they finally reached the other room at the end of this long, long corridor. Walking in, Jim was blinded for a few seconds, while he heard Kappa's disappointed exclamation, \u201c A toaster!? Damn, I wasn't even close! \u201d He then heard some rapid scribbling on what was probably her fifth or sixth notebook. \n\nAs Jim's eyesight slowly became adjusted to the bight light, he began to realize why he was so blinded. Much like the last room they were in, this was painted in white. With the exception of the glass roof, which for some reason was white so there was not really an exception, every single natural fiber within the room was white. Except for the toaster placed in the middle of table, which was placed in the middle of the room. Next to the table was a white lounge chair. On the perimeter of the circular room was a long bench, circling around. Man of Average Height had continued forward to stand in front of the toaster. \n\n\u201c Jim, \u201d he said, still pronouncing the foreign name with an awkward tongue, \u201c this is the trail room. You must prepare yourself to begin. \u201d \n\nJim looked around once more. \u201c What exactly do you mean, prepare myself for the trail? What am I preparing? \u201d \n\n\u201c So then you are ready, very good, \u201d Man of Average height replied to Jim's questions. \n\n\u201c Uh, no, not really. You didn't really answer what I had asked for\u2026 \u201d \n\n\u201c Please come over to the table Jim, and seat yourself into the chair. \u201d \n\nJim still was not really sure what was happening. He felt a gentle push on his shoulder, and turned around to face Robort. His screen read YOU SHOULD PROBABLY DO IT. IT MIGHT GET US OUT OF HERE FASTER. \n\n\u201c Yeah Robort, \u201d Jim started, \u201c but I don't know what I am getting myself into. I still don't know what is going on! \u201d \n\nJIM YOU MUST DO IT, was all the read on Robort's screen. Over and over again. \n\nJim still did not want to get into the chair. Which was why he was not sure how he ended up strapped into it. \n\n\u201c Sorry Jim, \u201d Kappa said. \u201c So far, all of my notes have been wrong. I need to have something right for my book! I can not lose my bet. \u201d \n\n\u201c Uh, sure, \u201d Jim responded. \u201c But how did you do that?",

He had quite the life. \n\nHe died a couple of years ago, and his funeral was rather interesting. An eclectic bunch showed up from all over the cosmos to pay their respects. There were knights in armor, wizards in their robes, the whole nine yards. I almost looked out of place in my suit and sweater vest. When most of the gathering looks like the cast from an old school RPG, the grandson with the accounting degree becomes the outlier. \n\nThings got stranger after the funeral, when the executor of the estate (who turned out to be some very powerful wizard from a planet in the Andromeda Galaxy) pulled me aside with what he deemed \"an urgent inheritance.\" I was intrigued to say the least. In his hotel room, I was informed of the large financial windfall coming my way. \n\nBut there was a catch. I now had the responsibility to tend to my grandfather's pet: a small dragon. Had it not been for his tail and long neck, he'd have been no bigger than a toy poodle. The executor/wizard explained to me that he was a dwarf species, and that the Andromeda Galaxy is swarming with very large dragons. He offered to show me around. I politely declined. \n\nMy grandfather named the dragon Drexel. Apparently, they were tight. During our trip home, from my granfather's final resting place in upstate New York, to where I lived in northern California (for obvious reasons, we drove), Drexel was flat the fuck depressed. \n\nIt took a couple of days for him to acknowledge my presence, or even eat. We were halfway back to California on I-80 before he even showed interest in food. It was french fries. He started to warm up to me after I got him a large order of fries at a Burger King.",

        "Waking up today was one of the weirdest experiences of my life. I look across the room to my suite-mate Sam, and instead of a tall red haired guy, I see a short red haired dwarf. Upon screaming at this sight he wakes up comes over to me and convinced me I was crazy. He said he had always been a dwarf. Am I going crazy? \n\nI need to clear my head so I decide to walk out of my room across the mess hall in the wee hours of the morning to talk to my other friend Mark. Upon knocking on the door a giant Orc comes bounding out sleepy eyed. At this of course my screams continue as I try to run away. But the massive Orc grabs my shoulders tuned me around and starts asking me why I was screaming. I thought it was quite obvious considering the fact that my second best mate had turned into a fucking freak. Again though he assured me within seconds that he had always been and always will be an Orc. What the hell is happening here? I am so confused. \n\nBoth Mark and Sam decided to talk me to the healer that was at the end of the hall. I figured it would be a good idea to get my head examined, and I was hopeful that the healer would be able to tell me I wasn't crazy. Walking into the cold wooden room we meet the healer, but once again I was in for a surprise. What awaited me was an elf. After freaking out, again, she convinced me that she had been an elf since she had known me. But she also decides to perform a routine check on my health which included a prostate exam. I don't think its necessary but both Mark and Sam started to back her up against my protests. Finally I submit to the test, get on the cold table with my ass up in the air ready. But instead of her fingers she reached into her drawer and I see her pull out the biggest, brightest red dild -- \n\n\u201c STOP. Just stop. This game isn't fucking fun anymore.

The chair creaked as he peered at the glass. \n\nThey knew he knew. \n\nHe jumped as a door opened, slamming into the wall as a large man walked in, turning carefully to close it back up. It locked with a heavy click, afterwards. Someone slid a bolt in after that too, the boy could tell, somehow. \n\nThe man sat down across from him, and leveled a calm stare. It was the sort of gaze that could see deep into a person, figure out everything there was to know. The boy stared back. He could do that too, now. \n\n\"You comfortable? Need some coffee, something to eat?\" The man asked, straightening his uniform. \"I can send someone to get it for you, if you want anything.\" \n\n\"No.\" The boy replied. He didn't want to talk. \n\n\"Listen, I was like you once. You're not the first to end up in a situation like this.\" The man paused, carefully motioning towards the mirror, and then the camera, watching in the corner of the room. \n\nThe boy could tell it was turned off. Those behind the glass left shortly after. \n\n\"I'm going to tell you a story kid. It's not a particularly long one, but it's the truth. I think you'll be able to tell that now- the truth I mean.\" He met the boy's eyes, waiting for some sort of recognition. \n\nShuffling his cuffs, the boy nodded slowly. The man began, his deep voice speaking in a heavy tone. \n\n\"When I was younger, I had to kill two people in my home, on a cold night in October. I remember it was dark and raining, I remember the wind was howling.\"",
        "Night had fallen on the snowy tundra and with it the warmth and safety that the day had brought was all but a memory. The cold was bitter and he had travelled far. Exhausted he looked on and in the distance saw his destination, the deep red glow piercing the blackness like a forge burning bight in a factory long forgotten. \n\nIt wasn't far now; but these last few steps would be the most gruelling. Through the snow, breathless and broken, under a starless sky he made his way towards the light. \n\nAs he drew nearer his eyes widened, enraptured buy what now stood before him; a temple of sorts etched in to the side of the rock face, bold yet humble in its magnificence. In front stood a man proud and stern as if carved form the mountain it self; his shadow, a bear, reared tall on the wall behind him, dancing by the light of a dying fire. \n\n\u201c Who are you? \u201d The guard said emotionless. \n\nThinking himself hidden he was startled by the mans keen eyesight and promptly composed himself \u201c I seek answers \u201d he murmured form the shadows. \n\n\u201c You will find none here. Leave now and forget his place or here you will remain until your lungs draw their last \u201d \n\nAs if both deaf and blind he stumbled forward heedless of the guards warnings, taking his first tired steps toward the heat of the fire. \n\nWhat appeared from the darkness was a man admonished of humanity, his bloodied feet and hands bandaged crudely with strips ripped from the rags he wore as clothes. As he moved closer the guard remained stone faced however the projection cast on the stone behind him told a different story; as anger turned to violence turned to shock turned to awe.",
        "He was everything I was meant to destroy, to purge. My strong cousins, twin sisters and I had a duty, to protect everyone from the likes of him. My particular task was to find ones like him and then call my cousins. Without me, they could hide and my sisters would never find them. Yet, there was something different about this one. I had to check him out, to feel him, to know him. \n\nI'm sure there was mutual interest at first. We were so compatible, it was scary. He was in my head all the time and everything was fine for years. But then he started bossing me around, I couldn't refuse! He was a part of me by then. I watched as I made more exactly like him, silent through it all. Soon, all of my twin siblings will be just as silent. My cousins won't know what to do. Then, any old snot can come to our home and cause real damage.",
        "Not exactly on prompt but I like the way my mind took this. \n\nWe exist. In a broad sense of the term. We are void and nothingness and all the things that give you nightmares. But we have no true form or mind of our own. \n\nNot until one of your own shows up. See you offer us deals. You give us form with your thoughts. Those lovely minds you little monsters have give rise to us. \n\nNothing exiats save for what is given form and you have given form to the most elaborate and vile creatures ever conceived. One day it will be your downfall but for now be content in knowing that you lose nothing and gain exactly what you want. \n\nFor I refuse to return to the void.",
        "\"You weren't supposed to kill him!\" \n\nI knew from the beginning that this meeting was destined to end in a resounding failure. Well, no sense delaying the inevitable. I went in with the verbal equivalent of dual-wielded SMG's. \n\n\"How the hell were we supposed to know that everyone got a messiah of their own? So what, we slightly maybe killed ours. I bet everyone else has too! He came in at a period in history that was.... violent, from an occupied country, and stirred up shit with the leaders of said country, *and* the religious leaders to boot! Hell, it was two thousand years ago, how are we accountable for their actions? \n\nWhat have I ever done to deserve this? I was born two thousand, one hundred and nine years after this, in an era where all he would have to do is get to a terminal and demonstrate a miracle. He'd be on a fusion-jet within the hour to the Core Planet, where he'd demonstrate again, and the leaders of all twenty-nine planets would make a decision in his favour. \n\nHe couldn't do that. In thirty-three years, he managed to convince a few thousand people, out of millions. Today, he could have reached millions in seconds. Jesus didn't even know what China *was*, or that the Southern Hemisphere even existed. You dropped a convict into the middle of a civilization with no planning and basic psychic tech and expected him to convince the world? If we executed him, it's down to your organization's poor planning.\" \n\nI stood, panting after the massive fillibuster I'd shot off at him. I silently berated myself for my stupidity; I'd done the holy equivalent of punching Jesus in the face. And then following up with a kick in the balls. Actually, more piling on the pain and kicking him once he was down a few times too.",
        "Here's to hoping this gets buried deep in the under-dark.... \n\nSo here's the deal.... I like a girl. I know, shocking, its not like anything else throws me for a loop. Even up and coming exams don't seem significant in comparison. There's nothing quite like being on the wave surfing adventure that is liking someone. Will Senpai notice me? Which in of itself is more of a joke than anything. To be honest, we're already best friends. And I know what you're already thinking, the dreaded friend-zone. But it's not as bad as it seems. You know? See it turns out, I put myself there with the full awareness that it was the only way to her heart. I say this because she's not really like any girl. \u201c Typical, does this start to get any good \u201d I hear you say. Well it's complicated. (I laugh as you try and not get frustrated at the cliches). But honestly, she's afraid of guys.... Well, I suppose afraid isn't the right word. I guess I don't really have a right word because I honestly have no idea what's going on in her head. I like to fool myself into thinking I do, but in the end I'm only guessing. Anyways, onto my point. She used to not want to date anyone, enjoying being alone to a certain degree. But that's not really true now is it. Today, she tells me about the boys she thinks are attractive, \u201c He looked like he came down from heaven \u201d she says. It's shit like that that gets on my nerves. You see, she doesn't have many girlfriends, so the rest of us guys get stuck hearing the stuff no guy wants to. But, acceptable losses right? Anyways, where was I. Oh yeah, she obviously has the desire to date now, she talks about guys and how she's the only one of her friends from her old friend group that doesn't have a boyfriend. This is where it get's complicated again, she's very shy and there's almost no chance she would actually try to make a move on one of the boys she fancies.",
        "*Oh no* \n\nJanes pulse quickened. The hunky man standing before her was magnificent sitting right in front of her typing at his qPad. He was the one. She knew it. All she could hear as she stared at him, practically salivating, was the sound of wedding bells. She knew she was crazy. This was crazy. This was a mixed blood type bar, it was for cheap drinks, fornication was frowned upon. No, an understatment, literally the police would come in and shoot you on sight. And they didn't stop there. Family, friends, casual acquaintences, pets all dead by summary execution by the thought police. \n\n*We're not meant to be together* \n\nThe thought pulsated in her head over and over. Every time becoming more resonant and sending pangs of regret and sorrow eminating from her heart outward, all the way out into wherever emotions go after you feel them, she had no idea where as her priest told her she did not yet have the appropreate theton levels or donate enough money to the church. \n\nLove at first sight, she never believed it was real. But it was happening, and now. All of her preconieved notions of who she was and what she was doing were going out the window. To even be caught thinking about this young Fabio/Arnold hybrid would be insant death. \n\nAnd yet..... \n\n*I can't help it* \n\nLove has no boundaries. It is an ephemeral entity that trancends space time. It trancends spelling, grammar, intelligence, wealth, race, gender. It is both the great divider and the great uniter, it is what makes our race great and it is our greatest foil. \n\nJane had enough of society. Of rules. Of the systematically brutal Orwellian dictatorship that had decided that blood type was the to be the divide, the ultimate decider in an unjust patriarchical society with infinite material wealth. But what is wealth without love, love is live and it is better to die with love on the lips than to live an eternity in anonimity and not know what it meanst to truely feel. \n\n*Fuck it* \n\nShe stood up and walked over to where the man was sitting, the corded muscles in his forearms dancing as he typed vehemently. He stopped abrupbtly. Only halfway across the room, Jane looked at him. He looked back. Piercing blue sapphire eyes gazing deeper into her soul than she had ever imagined possible.",
        "I threw myself to the ground, hoping that none of them had seen me. From the corner of my eye I saw Isaac, still standing, completely oblivious to what was going on. \n\n\"Get down!\" I whispered. He ducked down, his head just below the tops of the corn. \n\n\"Who are they?\" He whispered back as he began to realise our predicament. He shifted, trying to get closer to the ground without touching the mirey soil. \n\n\"I'm not sure,\" I admitted. \"But we weren't told to expect anyone.\" I strained my neck, trying to glimpse between the wavering plants to see any sign of them. \"I need to go closer.\" I said. \"Stay here.\" \n\nIsaac began to protest, but I motioned him to be quiet. \"You'll be safer here\" I said as I swam deeper into the crop. \n\nMy boots squelched quietly as I made my slow and cautious journey towards the landing site. Now and then I heard their rough yelling and wondered if they had finally spotted my path through the field. There was no gunfire, and nobody appeared in my vision. My fingers still gripped tightly around my gun, my eyes scanning for the second of movement that might warn me I was about to be discovered. \n\nAhead, I saw the light breaking through the corn; it must be the clearing. I eased myself closer, sliding my boots through the muck to try and stay quiet. \n\nGrey jackets with red eagles on the shoulders. Silver helmets. I grimaced. \n\nSlowly I slid my way back through the swampy turf, carefully maneuvering and trying not to move the corn above me. My trousers sucked up the dampness of the ground, making every step more difficult. Finally I found Isaac crouched where I had left them. \n\n\"Reds.\" I said, \"At least a dozen. They must have sent a landing team to look for the supplies.\" \n\nIsaac nodded. \"What do we do?\" \n\nI thought for a moment. There was no way we could take them on, not without Spike and Tem and not by daylight. But we couldn't just leave the dump there. \n\n\"Tonight.\" I whispered. \"We'll come back tonight. For now we find the others.\"",
        "*Jesus Christ, I need a distraction now, * I thought, my palms sweaty as could be when I brushed them against my suit trousers. I was visibly shaking, having to force myself to refrain from biting my finger nails as I waited for the biggest interview of my life. I tried everything; eyeing the cute receptionist, walking around a bit, humming.... Nothing has calmed me. \n\nMaybe some reading will help. My shaky hands brush through the stack of magazines to my right, finding nothing of particular interest. To the lefy, however, sits an old looking book, plainly bound in black leather. It was titled rather strangely, bold silver letters glinting at me in a striking font to spell out \"Life\". I shrug inwardly and lift the hefty thing, examining it a bit closer before I decided to jump in. The spine was crisp and without wear, in odd contrast to the rest of the book's binding - the covers were scuffed and dusty, the corners bent and worn. The pages were odd as well; from the beginning, they were old and worn, yellowed like any timeless classic. As they progressed, they got lighter and lighter, the end looking almost brand new and quite crisp to boot. I thought no more of it and simply opened it to a random page, my thumb choosing a line somewhere in the middle and beginning from there. I was about a quarter of the way into the book when I opened it, so I figured I could save some of the story elements for later. \n\n*The young man sat in the waiting area, nerves shot and stomach aflutter. His grey undershirt was beginning to feel the pressure of such a heavy moment, the job interview before him quite the turning point in his life regardless of how it went. * \n\nWell, that was odd. Grey undershirt with sweat stains, butterflies, and one hell of an interview? Maybe this book was just what I needed. With a roll of my eyes, I continued. \n\n*Hoping to calm his nerves, the young man searched for a distraction, finding one in a simple black book to his left. * \n\nOkay.... \n\n*He scanned it's pages, finding each line a little stranger than the last. Within a book's pages, man oft finds mysteries to be solved - this mystery just kept getting a little more strange. He sought comfort, yet this was anything but. \"Mr. LeFaire, the senior partners will see you now,\" called the receptionist. * \n\nWhat.... what the fuck? \"Mr. LeFaire, the senior partners will see you now.\" These words snapped my head up in their direction. Sure enough, those words had been spoken by the receptionist. My name was in the book. What she said.... it was in the book. I skipped a page, absolutely marveling at these events. My heart leapt into my throat at the next sentence, prompting cold fear to seep into my mind.",
        "She was surprised that there was someone waiting when she came out. It was hard to estimate time in The Pit, but she knew it had been a long time since she and the others went inside. \n\n\"Oh my god!\" the man exclaimed. \"Amanda Samuels!\" \n\nHe reached for a camera and snapped a quick photo before extending his hand out to her. \n\n\"Mike Jackson,\" the man said. \"It's an honor to meet you. I've been coming out here for the past ten months on assignment with the Daily News.\" \n\n\"Amanda,\" she replied, shaking his hand. \"How long have we been gone?\" \n\n\"Are the rest of you still alive?\" Mike asked. \n\nAmanda merely looked at him, waiting for an answer to her own question. \n\n\"Not as long as you might think,\" Mike said quickly. \"One year, eight months, and six days.\" \n\n\"You haven't got it down to the hour?\" Amanda smirked. \n\n\"Not quite,\" Mike said, with an embarrassed chuckle. \n\nAmanda laughed with him before her eyes turned to his camera. \n\n\"Do you want to say anything about what happened down there?\" Mike asked. \"This thing has live stream capability - I bet everyone would love to hear from you. Of course, I understand if you don't want to...\" \n\nAmanda shook her head. \n\n\"It's important that I get my story out there,\" she told him. \"I'm ready to go when you are.\" \n\nAfter making a quick but excited call to his manager, Mike set up the camera on a tripod. \n\n\"Let's roll,\" he announced. \"This is Mike Jackson, on scene with Amanda Samuels who has just emerged from The Pit, seemingly unscathed. Welcome back to civilization, Amanda. How did you do it?\" \n\n\"Thank you, Mike,\" Amanda said graciously. \"It certainly wasn't easy, I can tell you that. The darkness, the nightmarish creatures, the constant fear - it all starts to get to you at first.\" \n\nShe paused, and Mike smiled encouragingly at her. \n\n\"We tried to focus on the mission we were given,\" Amanda continued. \"We soon realized that fighting our way out wasn't an option. After we lost Dex, we didn't know how to go on.\" \n\n\"You and Dex were close,\" Mike remarked. \n\n\"Very,\" Amanda acknowledged. \"Knowing that he's gone still hurts me every day.

        "David Draiman of Disturbed couldn't believe what was happening. After constant struggle, months of battling it, he could no longer contain it. It was itching to break out, to explode into the world. Nothing could prepare everyone for what was next. \n\nIf you're lost, the best way to explain this is from the beginning. \n\nDavid was a nice boy from Brooklyn who enjoyed normal 80's activities for 10 year old boys of which I know none of, maybe playing with slinky's or riding penny boards, or wearing tiny shorts or something. Anyways he loved being a kid, until one fateful day he was abducted in the middle of the night. To his avail this wasn't an ordinary abduction, yes that day David was abducted by the gods of rock. He had previously listened to some Beatles and other popular rock artists of the past decades but music was something David ultimately dismissed as he frolicked through the 1980's doing 1980's things. \n\nAfter this night everything changed for David Draiman of Disturbed. \n\nDavid moved from city to city after that and began tuning out the observant Jewish tradition and tuning in his heavy guitar based music. He began \"rebelling against comformity\" to become a \"normal teenage kid\" started his own band in the different cities including L.A. and Milwaukee, and began practicing the religion of rock first and Judaism second. His parents were furious at times, but David was set to complete the voyage the rock gods sent him on all those years before. The 80's came and went, and all of his idols were becoming irrelevant as well. This sprung in the age of Heavy Metal. The first Metallica song David heard actually made him convulse due to the prolific nature and beauty of the intense rhythmic chords. The vocals, guitar, bass, and drums all created a wondrous symphony that David could not turn his ear from. \n\nOver the following decade acts such as Nirvana, Sublime, and Red Hot Chili Peppers emerged as top contenders with hit singles and albums that inspired David Draiman to link up with a struggling band called Disturbed in 1996 after they had a falling out with their lead signer. \n\nHis destiny was almost complete, and rock gods sat there all this time patiently watching as he David scaled, nearing the top of the Rock Olympus.",
        "Have you ever just woke up one day and realised, \"Hey, somethings different here\" thats what happened to me one sunny day. I woke up got around a bit and I realised to myself \"Well god damn, where did they go?\". I thought to look out the window to investigate. My god, the moving metal boxes weren't moving and none of the other owners were outside either. I panicked. I kept thinking \"Who's gon na feed me now? Who's gon na take me on walks?\". Until finally *he* appeared out of the shadows. \"What the hell are you doing walking around the goddamn place like a goddamn furry thing with a goddamn fluffy ass tail.\" he said. \"Whiskers, they're gone, they're all gone!\" I said in a panick. Whiskers eyes grew in size, \"My god, have you tried making the talking box talk?\". \"Don't you think I tried that already! It just keeps snowing!\". Whiskers then expressed \"Well then what the hell are we going to do? No talking box and no owners to give us food, we are screwed!\". I then said \"Well the owners would want me to be in charge of the house, so I say we must start thinking of a plan of some sort.\". Anger grew in Whiskers face \"Why do you think the owners would want you in charge?\". I looked at him and explained myself to him \"Well, they obviously liked me better, think of it! They brought me outside, they gave me bones and you are afraid of water!\". Whiskers anger grew even more \"Give me a goddamn break, you know why I don't like touching water, I don't like the feels of it on my paws!\" \"You always say that Whiskers!",
        "I turned the corner of my road, slipping in the snow and suddenly feeling the effects of the low-oxygen atmosphere at the top of Everest. \n\n\"Not again\". \n\nMy boss wasn't too happy when I called, I guess I'll need a new job now as well. It's frightfully cold up here, so I'm going to climb further up, that'll surely get me to the base camp. \n\nThe beach was nicer than the mountain at least, though I'm not sure when one became the other. The sand is warm, I've taken off my shoes and can feel it between my toes. I should find a telephone. I can see houses in the distance, but I have a good feeling about the other direction. I walked further along the beach, luckily I can see people. They're really big, all muscled and angry looking. It must be because of their physical work, they're all loading heavy bags of white powder into a boat. I waved hello and wandered down to see if I could help. \n\nI never made it there, down one dune, up another and there was the desert stretched out in front. That was a shame, those guys might have helped me. A soft idea started to bloom in my head. Like a bud bursting into shape, petals splayed out like the flower I saw last time I tried to go get my haircut. No giant wasps though, not this time; not in my head. \n\nI walked in the direction I thought was away from home, walking for hours until I'd built up quite a thirst. I stopped at one of the market stalls on the side of the busy road, bartering for a fruit juice. I wandered some more, through the dusty pyramids, empty damp temples and once through a round office with lots of shouting men. I'd almost given up on my plan when I'd finally returned home. \n\nI opened the front door, feeling the carpet beneath my toes with a simple joy. Maybe my next job shouldn't be so restrictive. Maybe a roving travel writer. I settled down into my chair waiting for the bit I liked least. The glowing cube floating down from its place on the shelf, the same creepy motion it's made since I could remember. The surface touching my forehead, connecting to my mind.",

        "*Notice: Any users mentioned within can ask me to remove them if they so desire. Yet I still think it would be rude. * \n\nWriting Prompts Incorporated,\"*We make your stories come to life! *\" is a booming business. Some bloke down on his life or up for a thrill submits a request for a story, the writers make it happen. The guy or gal who paid for it will go into through a door made with groundbreaking and unusual technology, and he or she will become whoever they would like to be in the story, an observer, the hero, the villain. If it is suitably popular it goes public and other people can try it out for a spin. Pretty good. Yet the stories almost always ends after about an hours worth of fun. The costumer goes home, forgets all his worries and such. The story is reset and a new person can try it out. It is good that it does, what is behind those doors are the other realities, when you enter in to that place you become part of the ride, and that is good. Yet Writing Prompts Inc. deals in many things, nightmares, perverse fantasies, dark desires as well as flimsy fantasies and lovely worlds of heroism and goodness. So when one day a clumsy worker forgot to close and reset a door properly, you could have hoped that it was the worlds made by a writer who was tasked with creating some utopia or a wonderful party. Unfortunately it was a door into an EU. \n\nThere are many types of requests, an EU is one where you get to enter into an original story for an established universe. And it just so happened that the one door that was opened was a door to an EU of Curious George where the titular character learns about something fun, you know, an EU for the kids. Yet the tiny ape escaped, and as curious as he was he activated a lot of other doors. And few of them good. The ape died when he opened a door into an EU about WH40K and was slaughtered by Space Marines, they then met the forces from a marching empire in an original story about space, and others yet zombies from a Apocalypse-Scenario. While the costumer is on the inside, they are guaranteed to survive, even if they die the story simply resets and they walk out the door. The opposite is not the case. \n\nAnd since things got heavy when Orcs from LOTR meet with sex-mad aliens from another dimension, when lord Eddard Stark comes marching out with an army only to meet with the forces of the living dead, that is where everything goes awry. And in the confusion and danger of it all, some people start noticing the war spilling into the streets from the Writing Prompts Inc. Dream Factory, the army got engaged. And the worst part is that some prompts are not meant to come out. Some doors lead to Cthulhu, others lead to things darker than that. Some leads to the end of all things. And one of those was opened. As the army bombed the factory, one last door was opened by a confused and scared cleaning lady who had been fleeing from sex-hungry fox-people before the bombing, the door contained something worse than warriors, more dangerous than zombies, more destructive than madness. It was a specially made prompt for the army, a battle simulation that would be able to test the toughest soldiers.",

In exchange, we would be rewarded with access to technology far beyond our own through trade, the customary 10 seats in the Parliament, and all but guaranteed military protection. \n\nIt had taken fourteen months to get Earth to this point. At first it had been easy - indie artists were easy to buy silence from. Web hosts blocked popular music streaming apps and scanned mp3s,.wavs, and other sound files. The more popular musicians fought back harder against the obtusely named Initiative for Intergalactic Peace and Quiet - the UN campaign to eradicate music. Records were destroyed, CDs were melted, Walkmans and iPods were steamrolled. Obstinate record executives were flung into the sun, teenage pop-stars' vocal cords were severed, Justin Bieber was personally immolated by the President on live TV. Nickelback played their final concert in the Large Hadron Collider. A smash hit. It was regrettably necessary for the survival of our race. The Republic had weapons the likes of which humanity had never seen, and they hated music. With a vengeance. \n\nSee, humanity wasn't too keen on wiping out a huge part of our culture, however imperative to our survival it was. Plans had been laid, machinations set into place, schemes schemed, and plots plotted. Favors were called in, hands were dealt and played, mail was blacked, and traps were laid. Behind the scenes, earth's scientists worked covertly to understand just why the aliens hated music so. There were some bio-chemical implications for some of the species, some behavioral impulse control in other species, but the reasons for this were murky at best. Humanity couldn't discern if music controlled them, or made them lose control - we weren't sure if it were an existential threat to the alien regime, or if it were a drug. \n\nWe didn't fully understand the War on Music. All we knew was that we thought the aliens would be unable to hold their Republic together if enough of them were exposed.",
        "When people ask me what I like most at my work I always answer \"The sound\" and everytime I get confused looks back. But that's what I'm expecting, because who would think of sounds when you talk about an art gallery? \n\nBut this is my gift, one reason why I am so good at my job, why I'm so enthusiastic about it. My favorites are the abstract paintings, colourfull, from calm to wild, with so many different possibilties. To a good painting I can listen for hours. Yes, listen. I hear colours. Brown has a dark timbre. Orange is a high screaming and pink is a set of soft strings. \n\nWhen I concentrate on a painting I hear nothing else. The song of this picture is everything I hear at that moment. You tell me where you want you picture and what kind of music you like, a question which startled a lot of my customers when they first come to me, and I can give you the perfect one for you. \n\nBecause I can see them.... because I can hear them.... and I love it, every day a little more.",

        "Susan always had a way with words. She was the type of writer who could give a semicolon a personality, she was that great! My arms and legs were riddled with scars, but her ebony skin had always been clean from marks. It's because she always had a way to tell the truth, but tell it in such a way that you wouldn't realize what she meant. \n\nFor example, one time she had forgotten to do her homework and when called on she sheepishly told the teacher that she hadn't figured out the problem. Not that she couldn't but simply that she hand't. \n\nWhen people asked her if they looked nice in particular clothes, she would either tell it straight or compliment individual features of the clothes- that girl was amazing! She helped me to get my way through school and taught me how to write better (hopefully it worked). \n\nSusan and I didn't speak for many years. During this time, I heard small whisperings that Susan wasn't doing well but that she wouldn't identify what was wrong, and weasel her way out of any scenario she found herself in by sheer tongue twisting. No one could figure out what was wrong. And her unmarked flesh became a sign of health to some, and a worry for others. \n\nThe last day I saw Susan, she made a fatal mistake. She mixed up her words, and lied. \n\nI was in town again for a New Year's party when I saw her familiar black hair through he crowd. I went to say hello and her appearance made me speechless. Her ebony skin had grayed out and her hair was thinner- even her once manicured nails were scraggly and unpolished. \n\n\"Susan, what's wrong?\" I asked. \n\nShe smiled wide, \"Why Martel, whatever would suggest that I am not alright?\" \n\n\"Well, your appearance.\" \n\nShe sighed, and looked back at me, \"Don't worry hon, I'll live.\" \n\nInstantly, the horror spread across her face alongside the scar across her back. It created a deep hollow from her back to just across her collarbone. The skin was crinkled and sore looking. \n\n\"I have to leave!\" She shouted. She bolted out of the room, her close friends chasing after her. \n\nThe next day I found out the news.",

I lay in the dark, scrolling through Reddit one last time. I want to check and see, maybe someone figured it out. But no. There are no new comments.... I'm alone and I have decided to escape the only way I can. I turn my music on, and lay in my bed, reaching for the pills I put as many as I can swallow in my mouth and take a drink. I do this three more times and then I wait. \nLaying there, feeling the pills start to drain my life, I suddenly hear a noise. Struggling I lift my head, and a face swims into view in front of me. I gasp and my eyes widen, it's harder to stay awake but I fight with all my strength. More faces come to view and I can hear them now. \"Where did she get the pills dammit?!\" \"I don't know, she has been acting out for days, clawing the windows and doors, screaming and crying out\" \"well go get the doctor now!\" \nI feel myself beginning to slip away as my mind try's to grasp what is happening, I can feel their hands on my, fighting for my life with machines, pumping my stomach.

        "Physical Attributes: This race is most similar to Earth's Jellyfish. They are dome shaped and have a body made of semi-porous rock encompassing a flexible membrane. (Imagine Drifblim from Pokemon had a kid with the Thing) These beings do not have eyes or any form of sensory organ similar to Earth creatures. They inhabit a gas giant planet, similar to Jupiter, and communicate using electrical impulses that travel through the gasses that encompass the surface of the planet. \nDespite sounding like rather primitive beings, they are able to communicate wholly and have developed a Monarchy-like society in which a select few govern over the rest. \n\nTechnology is in the form of circuits and is controlled in a manner similar to telepathy. As these beings use electrical pulses to communicate, they use these pulses to activate circuits in their machines and control them with their \"mind\" (quotes around mind as our concept of consciousness may be vastly different to theirs). \n\nCurrently they are having a good-ol' existential crisis. It seems that metal and machine components have been pulled in by their planet's gravitational pull. They can activate them, but they do not function in the same manner or for the same purpose as the machines they are accustomed to using. One machine seems to make an extension of the device rotate, they suspect it may be used for movement. Another piece emits a tone, they can not hear the tone, but can feel the waves pushing through their electrical pulses and through the gas around them.",
        "Aaron's legs were numb. The leather-bound swivel chair he sat in for eight hours a day gasped for air, and his computer screen daunted his already dry eyes. It was 3:28\u2014his pupils had a tendency to do laps with the second-hand of his watch for the last hour and a half of work. All day he heard mouse clicks, phone calls, and keyboards playing like a radio he wished he never bought. His eyes did another lap before closing for a slight second. What better time in the day for coffee than 3:30? \n\nHe let his chair breathe as blood rushed to his feet for the first time in what seemed like a year. His eyes now peered over the cubicles able to see the whole office, all seventeen workers, including his boss. Same people. Same spots. Every day. \n\nWith scolding hot coffee that had been sitting on the burner for too long in one hand, and a napkin for the predicted spillage in the other, he took the thirty-eight steps from the break room back to his cubicle. A five-foot by five-foot fortress built with flimsy walls and no privacy that he called his second home\u2014pathetic, really. When he returned, his chair took another gasp of air to last the remaining workday, and his legs began to deaden again as he leaned back in his seat. Cringing in pain at the first sip of coffee, he licked his lips and went to set it down next to his keyboard, when he noticed a slip of paper. \n\nWith a sore lip and wary hand, he picked up the sheet, glanced over his shoulder, and then began to read. \n\n> Dearest Worker, \n\n> How cowardly of me to leave a note instead of exchange a hand shake. My apologies. My name is insignificant to the events that will slowly unfold within the next hour and a half. All you really need to know about me is that I wrote this note for you\u2014only you.

        "\"Huh, always figured someone was watching me.\" Alex said when figuring out he was one of main characters of Perugini Paradise, a tv show that follows him along with his other family members (Perugini being his last name). \"I knew my life had to be interesting enough to make a tv show.\" Scrolling through the Alternate Universe's internet he found there were just as many fan fictions about his show as Harry Potter in his own. Scrolling through through the different titles he found one worth reading: \"Pokemon Yo\" \n\n\"You guys wan na walk to the breach way?\" Alex's cousins Mike asked looking up from his phone on the beach in Rhode Island. It was that time of year were the Peruginis take a family vacation to the beach during the month of July. \n\"I'm down.\" Said Chris, Alex's other cousin. \"I need to hatch some of my Pokemon eggs.\" Reaching in his pokepocket, Chris pulled out 3 small eggs in glass incubators. \n\"Roberto, hand me some of those Pokeballs.\" Nick, Alex's older brother, called to his other cousin. \n\"Sure thing.\" Roberto reached into one of the bags in between himself and his sister Lea to grab a handful of Pokeballs. \n\"Yo, it's lit.\" Said Matteo, Alex's youngest brother, as Roberto threw himself and Nick some balls. Walking past their dad and his friend Dan playing Kan Jam, they began their journey down the beach to catch'em all. \n\n\"It's not Staryu, it's Starme.\" Nick said as a joke a group of Starmes washed up on the beach. \n\"Pokedex says they're around 400 cp, better use some Razz berries.\" Alex said, throwing down some Razz berries for the Starmes to feed on.",
        "Some bystanders thought they were heroic, yet chosen to deny their ensuing pretentiousness. It was involuntary: the collective decisions that lead to the need to save what society would deem a fallen angel. A select few still felt a need to be a hero, rise above the other filth in the sty. Maybe life had some sort of sentimental value to those people, or maybe, charity was just a great ego-boost. It didn't matter in the end, though. The unsure appeals to hope and shout-outs to Christ, after the realization that they'd just fall on deaf ears, stopped. The misguided attempts would start up again, only to be drowned out by the random snippets of conversation by other passerby. \n\"JESUS! JUST FUCKING JUMP ALREADY IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LISTEN?\" Screamed an increasingly annoyed man, who was just trying to share his own shout-y version of the gospel a few minutes ago. \nThis sentiment was repeated, recited in the faces the gathering crowd. \nAs more and more time lapsed, the man's leather jacket became his only friend. The only thing protecting him from the howling wind that threatened his composure. \n\"Ah em.\" Clearing his voice: a strict juxtaposition to the uneasy silence. \nHe averted his eyes upwards towards a cloudy, gray sky\u2014yet somehow they still delighting in the nonexistent rays which burnt images and geometric patterns into his retinas. \n\"He said to them: Go!\" \nBottles of Blueberry vodkas and iPhones: were dropped for the first time. The whole herd rushed down the towards the water. Each, making a point of not getting too close to the man. The water soon became red, and he laughed as he walked back onto the bridge. \nOnce the job was done, he trudged along the middle of the road, knowing that no vehicle could hurt him. The man would slow his pace occasionally to scoff at the survivors, whose were maimed bodies wrapped around railings indicated an obviously desperate attempt to subvert the \"mind control.\" \n\"Please.... please...\" it trailed off, then rebounded...\" please...\" \nThe words were cut off, but he was sure the end was: \"kill me.\" \nThat cry resounded from every direction, inevitably dying out after some time.",
        "It is not easy to cut through a human head with a hacksaw. The blade binds and pinches and if you don't know where all the little bones come together you can get the blade stuck. The truth is it takes practice, everything does really but you never think about like that. \n\nThere is a trick though. There often is, once you've done a thing enough. the trick here was get a metal blade. Not metal but a blade for metal.

        "\"I'll meet you for coffee at our favorite cafe,\" Donna choked her words out through smoke damaged lungs, to her sister Katie, who checked her her phone again. \n\n\"Yeah, I'll tell Mom and Dad you died. See ya,\" Katie said as she placed her hand on her sister's burned-to-a-crisp arm and turned to leave. Katie had seen Donna die at least five times this year, and it was becoming a serious inconvenience. Katie had been called every time to identify the body or possibly speak to Donna before she died. It was always the same though, make sure her plants got watered, the cat got fed, and to meet at their cafe for coffee later. It was hard for Katie to keep her eyes from rolling when she heard Donna had slept with a cigarette and lit herself on fire. \n\nOn her way home from the dead body collection point, Katie walked past Ed the jumper. On the last Saturday of the month at approximately 6pm, Ed jumps from the highest bridge in Katie's town, falling face first into concrete. Katie once asked him why he did it and he explained that it was just time for him to be dead, like the old days, when people died forever. So he kept himself dead as much as possible by immediately killing himself when he was reborn. Over the years Katie noticed that while Ed's body repaired itself and looked to be functioning properly, he had become paler and more obsessed with being in his death state. Maybe the state of constant death was bad for Ed's mind. But Katie didn't dwell on that thought too much longer that, since Ed would be dead in two minutes anyways. \n\nKatie almost made it all the way home, until she remembered Donna's cat needed to be fed, those creatures died permanently if not cared for Katie remembered as she took a left down an ally next to her home. \n\n\"To die or not to die! This is your choice!\" A man yelled from a street corner as he waved fliers in Katie's direction. He shoved a pamphlet into her hands before she could object. The man walked quickly down the street with more pamphlets after a group of unsuspecting pedestrians. Katie was familiar people like him, the \"Cryo-nappers,\" a slang term for people who freeze themselves in a death like state for an extended period of time in hopes that death will be permanent again when they awake. Katie tossed the flier, she was pretty sure no one was working on a cure for their semi-perminent death state. Why would they? Death was the ultimate disease. It was cured. There was no undoing it, only living with it. \n\nKatie made it to Donna's apartment and stopped to text her parents: \n\n\"Donna died again.",
        "The awkward box shuffled beneath Jack's coat as he continued wandering through aisles with an empty stare. This would fall under either pride or envy, he thought. Juggling between the Big Seven, Sloth came in third. He had been meaning to read a book or two. Eventually -- when he found the time. He shrugged as he decided it didn't matter. Either he'd walk out this store a conceited, vain but dumb man or in handcuffs. Jack's history as an accidental shoplifter reached legendary status on a few occasions. \n\nHe couldn't shake the vision of his mother running a comb through her hair. Definitely blonde, golden even. Not so sure if it was as long as he remembered or had nostalgia turned it waist-length and curled? Things changed; peoples' attitudes changed. Their tastes never faded from fickle and cruel but that was towards other people. The guilt ran through him, *but towards other people* - as if that made it okay. \n\nSo he hadn't finished a crossword puzzle lately or voluntarily sat through a documentary. Using the word'eclectic' to describe his taste in music passed in online dating profiles and work lunches. No need to remind anyone he couldn't remember what it meant months after looking it up for the fourth time. His strong jawline and the dimple on his chin did the heavy lifting during bar crawls. Lately though, women craved depth, substance. Pulling it off with a headful of stark blond hair was impossible. The subtle hypocrisy of looking for something meaningful using the most superficial means made him smile. \n\nGoing to lengths to get laid wasn't new to mankind. Hell, the species practically relied on a man's ability to convince a woman of his suitability. So what if it wasn't always completely honest?

        "It was just so much easier then he had originally thought. Joe reflected how he just simply offered the hooker a drink, laced with rohypnol of course, and moved the limp unconscious body into his truck. He was driving to his private residence, deep in the sparsely populated backwoods of his town, where no one would disturb him. \n\nIn a way, Joe didn't want to do this, but he couldn't stop fantasizing the time he would spend with his new guest. In his lonely isolation, Joe lost touch with the world. He could never seem to socialize properly to get girls to like him. With his increasing age, and worsening appearance, Joe could not afford to wait any longer. And so, Joe had convinced himself that if they just could spend a little more time with him, one would perhaps fall in love with him. So he came up with a plan, he would kidnap girls he liked, and force them to stay with him. If they wanted out, if they could not eventually like him back, well, he obviously couldn't let them go to the police.... could he.... In any case, Joe was hoping that it did not have to come to that. The lonely truck turned onto the dirt path that would eventually lead to his home, not realizing that it was not as empty as he thought it was. \n\nJoe entered his residence. It was thoroughly cleaned up in preparation of his \"guest\". He had to make a good first impression after all. He laid the hooker.... no.... his female acquaintance, on the couch, and went to work on tying her hands and feet. Joe would not take the chance of his guest running away before he could properly introduce himself. \n\n\"Hey Joe,\" a voice said, in a calm and even tone, but startling Joe nevertheless. Turning around, he saw an old, but fit, bearded man sitting at his kitchen table. Frozen in shock, he just stared at the old man. Someone caught me? Already!? But I was careful! Do I kill him? Who else knows? Am I going to prison? \nThose were the thoughts that fired around in his brain. His body screamed action, but his mind did not know what to do. \n\n\"Listen to me very carefully,\" the old man said, again in a steady tone. Without an idea of what to do, Joe did just what the man said. \"I am you, from the future.\" The old man had a stern look in his eye. \"And what you are doing will never work.\" The old man began telling Joe, in detail, all the things that he did and would do. Joe had told no one of his desires, yet this old man knew every part of it. \n\nUpon hearing what the old man had to say, Joe realized that the old man was telling the truth. He saw himself, older yes, but strikingly close in resemblance. Joe could not say anything, he was dumbfounded. Stressed by the in-normality of the situation, Joe broke down. \n\n\"What am I supposed to do?\" Joe whimpered, tears rolling down his face now. He was caught, and by his future self no less. The old man sat up and made his way toward his sobbing younger self. With a empathetic pat on the shoulder, The old man handed Joe a card. \n\n\"This was the place I went to when I realized what I've been doing, they're probably starting out now, but they really helped me see the wrong I had been doing.\" The old man had a solemn look on his face now, \"It was too late for the people I had hurt, but you still have a chance to make things right.\" \n\n\"What about her?\"",
        "So my friends and I kind of took this prompt and ran with it. We each wrote a section of each separate story and, well....it gets strange, hope you enjoy them! \n\nFIRST STORY \n\nWhen I came to, I was in what looked like the break room to an office building. In fact, it was my office building. That couldn't be though, the last thing I remember I was staring a semi-truck in the face. No, I was definitely dead, but could this really be heaven? I searched around and saw a pretty normal looking man in business casual dress at the water cooler. \n\u201c Hey, uh excuse me buddy, what-where uuuh- \u201c \n\u201c Oooh you must be the new guy, the head honcho said we was doing some training today.

And I'm afraid you're mistaken kid, this here is Hell. \u201d \n\u201c What?? You mean my religion wasn't the right answer? No, no I-I-I need to speak to the Devil at once \u201d \n\u201c Hahaha kid, you don't know where you are. You can't just go speak with the Head Honcho, the big cheese, the Heatmeister himself. You- hey where're ya going? \u201d \n\nI decided I'd had enough of that guy, I dealt with suck ups like him back on Earth and I wasn't about to let be the case here. I went to the directory and looked for his room number. Sixth floor, room sixty-six. Of course.

        "I'm getting sick of it. \n\nEvery time, every single time I get in this car, something ridiculous happens. I'm an honest man, trying to make an honest living, and I have to put up with this. For some reason, every hard-boiled detective, fugitive space warrior, and mobster-with-a-heart-of-gold chooses this cab. \n\nI'll be sitting there, waiting for a fare - a normal fare - and along they'll come. All I want is a nice old lady who needs to go to the shops, or a couple heading for the airport for a romantic break. But no - I get the secret agents with armoured briefcases, and plucky reporters who have a \"complicated\" relationship with a superhero. \n\nIt's all \"follow that car\" and \"step on it\", and then off we go on a ridiculous car chase. \n\nIn the past three weeks, I have driven through fourteen large barns, each time coming out surrounded by squawking chickens. I have jumped a missing section of road eight times. And I have been punched by a masked ninja standing on the hood of my car six times. The doctor says my nose will never fully straighten. \n\nIt's not good for my blood pressure, I can tell you. Every day is another high-speed race through downtown Tokyo, or Megacity Prime. I don't know how we get there - I live in Bradford. Yet suddenly, we'll turn a corner and be speeding through some high-tech hellscape in a hover car. \n\nAnd it's never a peaceful place, either. The most relaxing so far was a mountain road - I think it was the Swiss Alps, or somewhere. Lovely scenery. But two minutes after we get there, I'm having to swerve to dodge rockets and accelerating full tilt at a Nazi helicopter. The square-jawed fella in the cowboy hat wasn't helping, either - he kept shouting at me to \"hold her steady\" while he lobbed grenades and flirted with some Russian bird. \n\nI'm alive, so far. I've been shot at, stabbed, set on fire by a terminator. Pre-cognitive cops shot out one of the tires, and I ended up with whiplash. Whiplash that is never going to heal if I keep on ending up in hansom cab on the trail of the Gang of Four. \n\nNerves of steel, I'm telling you. That's what you need to have. And I've been trying to develop them, but it's hard to build your courage when you are constantly scared shitless. I thought I had a handle on it, but then it was all \"Red Leader, standing by\", and I was hurtling towards something that definitely wasn't a moon in a giant letter. The git in the back's constant beeping was not an aid to my concentration. \n\nIt doesn't even pay that well. Every time the journey finishes, all I get is a handful of money and a gravelly \"keep the change\". Half the time, it's not even legal tender - it'll be a bunch of Imperial credits, florins, or conflict diamonds. What am I meant to do with them? And even when it is real, modern money, it's never enough. Not for the journey, and the petrol (do you have any idea how much starship fuel costs?), and the cleaning fees. You try getting pterodactyl blood out of a grille without professional help. \n\nI thought it was too good a deal to be true. \u00a3300 for a car - in good working order - with one careful owner and all the modern conveniences. Nobody mentioned that it would send me all over time and space to be shot at by aliens and savage tribesmen.

Even her kids have taken her cue and have settled a little. \n\n\n*Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling \"Yoo-Hoo! \"* \n\n\"Mommy, why are you humming a Christmas song,\" her little girl asked. \"It's June!\" \n\n\n\"You know sweetie, I have no idea.\" \n\n\n*Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you. *",
        "For the past week, I've been staring at my phone and wishing it would make some kind of noise. A text, phone call, I'd even take one of those damn annoying amber alert system messages. I can't stand the silence, I can't stand being in the dark. Your pictures still haunt me on Facebook. \n\nYour smile, the little dimple on your left cheek that only showed up when you were truly happy. I lived for that dimple. It's strange, we complain about people putting too many photos online, but that changes when the person is gone. Now, I am asking myself why we didn't take more pictures together. Why we didn't ever follow through on our plans \n\nWe were all talk. \n\nAnd now your parents made me come to this stupid party. \"It'll make you feel better!\" They told me. What they really meant was, \"It'll make *us* feel better.\" And that's fine. They've been great this past week and I don't mind being the strong one on the outside. I don't mind being the one who acts like there is nothing wrong. \n\nBut on the inside, I am dying. The pain just gets worse the closer it gets to midnight. Fuck, I really don't want to do this. I don't want to scream, \"HAPPY NEW YEAR!\" and then turn around to kiss someone who is not there. I don't want to go home to an empty house. \n\n\"Thirty seconds left! Here we go!\"",
        "\"Hey, there's something I wanted to try out...\" \n\nI raised my eyebrow and turned to face her: \n\n\"Again already? Well, I'm not exactly in shape right now, but what's on your mind?\" \n\n\"Not that, silly,\" she punched me playfully. \"I wanted you to.... you know.... read me.\" \n\nMy face instantly went red, as I scrambled up in bed. \n\n\"Hey! Don't joke like that!\" \n\n\"Who said I was joking?\" she raised her voice. \"How can you be such a prude after *that*?\" \n\n\"Th-that's different.\" I started rubbing my forehead. \"That's physical.\" \n\n\"So it was just physical for you!?\" \n\n\"You know that's not what I meant!\" \n\nShe smiled. \n\n\"Yeah, I know, I'm sorry. It's just such a turn on: to be completely exposed to someone you love, to know that they can hear your every thought, every little worry, every silly thing that pops into your head. And the fact that it's such a taboo doesn't help either.\" She looked up at me, blushing a bit herself. \"Do you think I'm weird?\" \n\nI sighed. \n\n\"Yes, and that's why I like you.\"",
        "\u201c I'll give you some time to think about this, alone. \u201d the employer said, as he walked out of the room closing the door behind him. I sat at the table with many thoughts running through my head. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity and all I had to do was sign the contract. \n\n\u201c We can make this decision quick. \u201d the devil said, making himself visible on my right shoulder. \u201c Sign the contract. Isn't this what you've always wanted? \u201d \n\nI began to think of all the opportunities that would open up for me. \n\n\u201c Yes! \u201d I shouted. \u201c I'd be able to finally put my work out there for the world to see! \u201d \n\nThe devil began to laugh. \u201c Yes, yes. Now, tell the employer you're ready to sign. \u201d \n\n\u201c What good would this be? \u201d the angel said, as she too made herself visible but on my left shoulder. \u201c What would you really get in exchange? \u201d \n\nThe angel also had a good point. I mean, the contract was mediocre. The job also required so much out of me. Not to mention I would no longer be able to share the last days with my mother who had become very ill with little chance of survival. \n\n\u201c Guys, I don't know what to do! \u201d I began to talk fast. Anxiety had begun to set in. \u201c I can't just leave my mother now. Oh but the money I can make so much and I - \u201d \n\n\u201c Sorry I took so long. \u201d Abruptly, I stopped talking as the employer emerged from the opening door. The angel and the devil became invisible. It was now time to make that decision.",
        "\"10, 56, 27, 9, 27, and\u2026 41! \u201d \n\nPatrick O'Witty held the coffee-stained lottery ticket in a quivering hand, his red-rimmed eyes staring at the flickering television screen in utter disbelief. His eyes began to itch and burn when he realized he hadn't been blinking. He checked the numbers several times, certain he was mistaken. The numbers on those silly white ping pong balls inexplicably lined up with the ticket in his hand. The audience on the television applauded and the host displayed a collection of pristine, gleaming teeth as he smiled at the camera. \n\nHe won. \n\nPatrick O'Witty was a billionaire. \n\nHis heart began to race as he reverently set the small paper on an end table, his mind struggling to comprehend what was happening. A burning mixture of anxiety and glee made him light-headed. Luck had finally turned in his favor. \n\nRecovering from a terribly unfair divorce settlement, Patrick struggled to make ends meet. He had been working double shifts at Weinmeier's, a local grocery store chain that had been slowly but steadily growing. Paul Reichart, the assistance produce manager, had been selected to head their new store over in Boughtown. That left an open promotion and Patrick knew he was the favorable selection. \n\nHe wouldn't need that anymore. \n\nHe'd never worry about money again. \n\nIt only took one week for Patrick O'Witty to realize that sudden and incredible wealth isn't what he thought it would be. \n\nThe phone was ringing again. \n\n\u201c Hullo? \u201d \n\n\"Pat? \u201d the voice sounded slightly muffled and entirely unfamiliar. \n\n\u201c Yeah? \u201d he rubbed his throbbing temples with an unsteady hand. \n\n\u201c Pat! My God, it's good to hear your voice! It's your cousin, Tamara! \u201d Patrick couldn't confirm or deny if he even had a cousin named Tamara. \n\nHe hadn't heard from any of his family in over a decade, yet the past week had the phone ringing off the hook with aunts, uncles, second-cousins, twice and thrice removed. He did a little googling but still didn't understand what that meant. \n\nPatrick set the phone down gently on the cradle as the excited voice jabbered on the other end. He'd been warned this might happen, and he had tried to prepare himself for it. The sudden barrage concerned family only accentuated the loneliness that had consumed his life for so long. \n\nHe winced as an authoritative knocking suddenly struck his front door. A strange social anxiety had made an unwanted appearance in those gloomy days. Frequent visitors and press came to his home to offer their hollow congratulations on his near record-breaking jackpot win. He sat behind curtained windows, pretending he wasn't home, visibly cringing until the knocking ceased and the unwelcome guests went away. \n\nHe shot a glance at the red polo shirt that hung on an arm chair in the darkened living room, forgotten. \u201c Weinmeier's Grocery \u201d was proudly embroidered on the breast pocket along with an assortment of colorful fruit.",
        "He reaches back to feel it again. \nStill there. \nHe ties his shoes. \nHe adjusts his tie in the mirror. \nHe touches it again. \nStill there. \n\nA small round knob, barely the size of a thimble, protrudes from his neck just above his snow-white collar. \nHis inner monologue races. \"How long has it been there? Should I see a doctor? Does everyone have one? Impossible, I would have noticed. But I just noticed mine. Can everyone see it?\" \nHe touches it again, still there. \n\nBarry Roper, the average height and slender, quiet, shy, clumsy, and most notably unlucky man is taking his chance today. He loathes his days emptying the trashcans along the residential neighborhoods. He is unsatisfied with his constant state of financial desperation. Renting a small studio apartment, perpetually drowning in stress, anxiety that the next time he turns his car key nothing will happen. Barry is not satisfied, and he finally dug up the courage to do something about it. \n\nBarry's true passion is cards. Texas Holdem and Pot limit Omaha, he never misses a televised high stakes game. He dreams of building a bankroll and taking it to Vegas. When anyone mentions the greatest players of all time, his name will come up. When he sits at a table a crowd will gather. Only the most courageous or foolish players will remain seated. But beginning that journey wouldn't happen today. Only two days ago the casino posted an add looking for dealers. Good dealers make good money. With all of his practice pitching cards alone in front of his television, watching old tapes of poker world championships, Barry was a good dealer. \n\nThen, this morning, the dial appeared. Barry twisted his back and leaned into the mirror to get a better look. White lines, raised like scars, wreathed the brassy knob. Alternating lines were marked with a digit increasing in value going clockwise around the peculiar blemish beginning with 0 near the eight o-clock position. Barry stretched his torso to the left; The numbers ended at 16 on the other side. Straining to see it clearly from the corner of his vision, just above the knob sat a triangle pointing at the number seven. \nThe mouse of a man gingerly caressed the newly discovered anatomy, feeling the cold hard shell. He tugged it gently. Like tugging his own ear, he knew it would not be removed painlessly. \n\nThoughts raced in Barry's mind. \"What are the numbers? What will happen if I turn it? will it even turn? Maybe it's just an odd mole and I'm just imagining things. Stress and nerves. That's what it is.\" \nHe couldn't resist.",
        "I see the blinding lights of the headlights through the dark stormy atmosphere. With a loud pound of the car and the crack of my body I felt the hard metal impact my small weak body yet felt little pain. I cant feel pain when im in this state of mind, a positive of this affliction. I lay on the cold hard wet road while my life slips away slowly I fade out into darkness my breathing slows to a shallow breath as the ambulance siren in the background muffles more and more. \n\nSuddenly my eyes open partially, I can breath again. I look down im sitting on somthing soft and comfy and white. My torn dirty old clothes are now skinny jeans and black converses, like the ones I wore throught highschool. As my vision gets better I can see that Im sitting on a small bed in a blue bedroom decorated with trophies and awards. I can hear loud muffled music playing in the background and people talking. I get overwhled with dejvu, I cant put my finger on it. I look across the room and see my ex husband seemingly a decade younger acrose the room in a seperate similar looking bed with his eyes closed. Somthing looks diffrent about him. \n\nAs I look closer I notice gone are the dark circles around his eyes scabs on his face and arms. He looks sober and healthy a sight I havent seen in about 12 years. He notices me looking up at him gets up off the bed and walks over.",
        "I was stunned. That apparition's proposal seemed simply too good to be true. Doubt \u2013 or maybe it was skepticism \u2013 crept into my mind, churning away at the potential \u2026 and the risk. \u201c You mean to tell me, you will grant me one \u2013 just one wish \u2026 anything I want? \u201d \n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\nThe apparition nodded, thin lips curling into a charming wry grin \u2013 too charming. \u201c That's about the size of it, mortal. \u201d He answered. His words echoed through my consciousness \u2013 a graveled, singsong tenor \u2013 as if every syllable hinted of Damocles. \n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\n\u201c But at what cost? \u201d I asked, turning my attention to the brass vessel from whence he came, taking refuge from his countenance in the filigree etched into its contours. In those etchings I found some odd sense of peace. When I returned my attention to the apparition, he merely shrugged. \n\u201c None that I could hold over you, mortal. \u201d Once the wish is made, I'll hold no power over you. From there, what you make of your wish is up to you. \u201d \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\n\u201c Right \u2026 I'd like a do-over, then. I want to go back and change my greatest mistake. \u201d \nThe apparition sighed, eyes rolling as he ran his fingers through his hair. \u201c Are you sure, mortal? Is that all you want? \u201d He paused, shaking his head. \u201c No riches? No power? \u201d \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\nI shook my head. \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\n\u201c Knowledge? \u201d \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\n\u201c Not even women? \u201d \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\n\u201c Men? \u201d \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\n\u201c Neither. \u201d I answered. \u201c I just want to go back and correct my biggest mistake. \u201d \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\nAgain the apparition sighed, shoulders slumped in resignation. \u201c Very well, mortal \u2026 your wish is granted. \u201d \nIn an instant, my world was consumed by light. \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\nSomething about this seemed all too familiar. I was stunned of course. The apparition's proposal seemed simply too good to be true. \u201c You mean to tell me, you will grant me one \u2013 just one wish \u2026 anything I want? \u201d \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\nThe apparition nodded, thin lips curling into a charming wry grin \u2013 too charming. \u201c That's about the size of it, mortal. \u201d He answered. His words echoed through my consciousness \u2013 a graveled, singsong tenor \u2013 as if every syllable hinted of Damocles. \nSomething about his words send a chill down my spine. \u201c D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u201d I muttered, thrusting my hands in my pockets as I looked away. \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\n\u201c What was that? \u201d The apparition demanded. \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\n\u201c This all just feels familiar. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again. \u201d At that, he just laughed. \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\n\u201c What? What's so funny? \u201d \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\n\u201c You begin to see, mor\u2014 \u201c \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\n\u201c ALBERT! My name is Albert, not \u2018 mortal.'\u201d The apparition clutched his belly in uproarious laughter, speaking through gasps and snorting chortles as he attempted to collect himself. \u201c I know \u2013 you've told me! \u2013 HA! More than once!",
        "I had always felt passion but was never molded by it. The blood is burning my eyes now. My rage has defined me. A tangy mix of blood and sweat is beginning to fill my mouth. I found the edge and tossed myself across what was once a defined line in my mind. The pain is real. My hands feel deformed, alienated from the rest of my body. They have always been this way. They never needed me, they always knew what to do. I feel alive..... I feel. Where is the laughter the joy? In the moment of my epiphany I feel no joy? I realize now I have been forcing the emotion all along. This is who I am, this is what defines me. I can feel myself seizing, shaking, filling with rage. I growl from the deepest parts of my soul. The sound bellows from my body to a wicked tune. I feel better, I do it again cracking the silence in the room again with the sound. The blood is drying and beginning to stick to my face. The damp sleeve of my arm motions to rub against my eyes. I can fucking see. The room is still as dark as I left it. I can feel my pupils shifting into the darkness. My hand are crafting something beautiful I can feel it. The stone floor fills the room first. I can see it sprawling the floor with its cold glow. My hands shift carefully crafting my art. I feel alive, My soul wants to scream. I want to yell but all I hear is laughter. The laughter is filling the room, bouncing off the walls. The laughter is breaking my silence. The laughter is breaking my mind. How did I get here? What is happening? My eyes are focused now, I can see now what my hands have been doing. A masterpiece indeed. This guy had the wrong idea. He thought he was going to teach me a lesson. I want to scream but my mind only laughs at my attempt. He should have never come in here. He should have left me alone. I want to scream but the fucking laughter is too loud now. The door is moving, I cant stop laughing. A shadow is moving towards me I clench the fragment of bone from the prisoners jaw and move into the shadow. I press my weight behind my thrust as to pass the bone through the shadow to stop its presence in the room.",
        "*The weight of her body in his arms was all Jack could think about. He was so happy she was alive. This moment was all that mattered. He looked Tiffany in the eyes and said \"Hey Tiff, you know what I want to change about this moment?\" A smile crept up on her face and she asked \"What?\" he quickly responded: \"Nothing! I would change nothing about this moment.\" She laughed and leaned into his chest* \n\n\"Really dude? I mean come on, you wouldn't change anything at all? You've known this girl for what, 8 months? You're fucking 29 years old and now this girl's existence is your primary source of happiness?

You got ta narrate this stuff right!\" \n\"Yea whatever, Bill. Serves him right.\" \n\n*As Jack leaned forward to nuzzle his head into Tiffany's hair, he suddenly felt uncomfortable. ``.... Damn. Am I a giant cunt?\" he thought to himself. \"What's wrong Jack?\" Tiffany said as she leaned her head down to his lap and looked up at him. \"Oh nothing, what do you mean?\" he asked. \"I don't know, you seemed distracted for a minute...\" she said as she touched her finger to his chin. He just smiled and kissed her. He always like the little bump on her bottom lip that she had from cutting it when she was a child. Her tongue fluttered into his as she took a deep breath. His breathing quickened as he thought tonight might be night that they make love. * \n\n\"Wait what. Bill, you mean to tell me this fucking guy hasn't banged this broad and he's already quoting that line from Talented Mr. Ripley when Matt Damon is trying to bang that dude on the boat?

        "*** [ EU ] Fallout Universe. *** \n\n\"Everyone good? Sound off\" Paladin Daemus' voice echoes across the dusty corridor. \n\n\"Liam, here\" Liam is the Heavy gunner, the ammunition mule. \n\n\"Joyce, here\" Joyce is the only initiate in the task force who filled in last minute due to an injury of another task force member right before deployment. \n\n\"Halter, here\" Halter is the team technician, he is key to this mission's success. \n\nSilence ensues the next couple of seconds after Halter sounds off. \n\n\"Clark, are you there?\" Daemus says. He receives no reply. \n\nHalter uncovers Clark's corpse, his armor was heavily dented and was blasted inward to his ribcage. \"Clark's gone.\" \n\n\"Well, Shit. Get his holotags and lets push onwards\" \n\n\"Sir Daemus\" Initiate Joyce yells out, as her ears are still ringing. \"Is this gold still worth it?\" \n\n\"This isn't about treasure hunting, Joyce. We're doing this for the good of the brotherhood. Not only will it help us gain wealth in terms of material standards, but in here lies the entire digital copy of the national archives.\" \n\n\"But sir,\" Joyce rebutts \"We've already lost 5 men. We're not even sure if-\" \n\n\"We will PUSH ON, That is an order.\" Daemus yells out as the ceiling crumbles fine dust down to the floor, illuminated by the dying light of one of their flares. \n\nHalter finished stripping down Clark's body of any useful supplies, Ammunition, Stimpaks and his holotags. \n\n\"Halter, throw in another flare, down the hall, and we'll keep on moving.\" \n\nAs the flare Halter lit slides across the end of the corridor and into an intersection, the hallway is suddenly lit up with gunfire, and darkens again when the flare was put out by lead. \n\n\"Goddamnit, there's another fucking turret in the corner.\" Liam exclaims. \n\nThe group huddles near the corner where they suspect the turret to be. Liam throws a pulse grenade. A small explosion is heard, but the sound is dwarfed by the whizzing of electricity. \"Is it out?\" Joyce asks. \n\nLiam pulls out his gun and waves it in front of the turret. No response. \"It's down.\" \n\nAfter they pass the labyrinth of corridors inch by inch, meeting turret resistance along the way, they manage to enter the grand entrance. \n\n\"That should be it, sir. The vault is down the hall.\" Halter says with relief. \"The turrets in this room seem to be down, Probably linked to a different mainframe or something.\" \n\n\"Lets move then, slowly and quietly. This part will likely be rigged. Watch for any pressure plates.\" Daemus says, worried of possible traps that still work 200 years after the war. \n\nThey manage to reach the other side of the room with no resistance at all. The whole team lets out a sigh of relief, their mission is almost over. Before them stands the door of a great vault, similar to those vault shelters that litter the wasteland of post-apocalyptic america. But this one is bigger, sturdier. Inside it is the gold reserves of a once powerful nation, but more importantly, the knowledge of the old world. \n\n\"Halter, check the terminals, see what you can do about opening the doors, if we can't, we may have to blast through one of the walls.\" \n\nAs Halter gets on a terminal, he begins overriding the system, trying to find a way to open the vault. The eerie quietness of the underground complex is almost deafening. With only Halter's keystrokes and Liam's heavy breathing to break the silence. The room is almost pitch black, if it weren't for the faint emergency lights flickering across the room and the green glow of the terminal that Halter is hacking.",
        "Secret agents are people, too. \n\nFew understand the depths of boredom that comes with serving in a secret organization. A key component of being recruited is your appearance, namely that you don't stand out in a crowd and have all of the'common feature' traits without any identifying marks of any kind. You are then disappear from society and do everything you can to not get a wound on any part of your body that's normally visible. \n\nSeriously, they put padding on your shower head. \n\nIt doesn't help that whoever thinks of themselves as the interior decorator of these agencies thinks that grey is an exciting color. If I were to go color blind one day I'd never notice. \n\nOne of the few graces we are allowed, as agents, is to ability to pick our code-words. Someone actually grasped the concept that being able to understand each other when speaking into the tiniest microphones in the world over the weakest wireless network in the world was important to do our jobs. \n\nA lot of our spare time is spent talking to each other inside of sound-proof boxes and finding out how often we misunderstand each other. Only the phrases and terms that have at least a 99.7 % success rate are allowed as valid code-words. \n\nTrust me, it takes a LOT of whispering into a tiny microphone to reach a number where 99.7 % is a valid measurement. \n\nNaturally, we tend to start with realistic statements that would actually make sense if someone were to over-hear: \"I wonder if I left the oven on.\" or \"Shit, there's Miranda, she looks hot tonight.\" It's really quite remarkable how having a diverse set of regional accents can mess up perfectly legitimate phrases when heard with a sound quality that of gargling marbles while drowning in pancake batter. \n\nSo you see, \"Thank god\" became our term for \"Extreme danger\" and \"Full of spiders\" became out term for \"is looking towards the entry door.\"",
        "*You have been found worthy. * \n\nI entered through simple glass doors, and encountered something I'd never come across in my life. It was a hall, lined with weapons leading off into Eternity; a never-ending misperspective, mocking my mere humanity. \n\nImmediately to my left, a thin blade, barely the width of my thumb, lodged into an obsidian stone. To my right? The legendary weapon *Masamune*, as wielded by the nemesis Sephiroth from the game *Final Fantasy VII*. So, it continued onwards, the weapons singing their hymnal call. \n\nBut not for me. My path lay in vengeance, and I feared that I was disallowed from all of the weapons.The chorus of metal and wood sang, louder and more vicious with each step. I had barely spent a minute wandering that infinity, when....silence. Like a library. \n\nA clarion call, in quadruple harmony. **You are mine, Singer. I shall reveal myself to you momentarily. ** I stood, wondering what would happen, when merely the impossible did - the hall shrank, the weapons chanting. *An-ka-hei-la, An-ka-hei-la, An-ka-hei-la-an-ka-HEI! * # \n\nA solemn silence. A pedestal. Vengeance. Solemnity. A glimmer. Blindness. \n\n....And there it was, a small dagger, golden in appearance, entwined within it, a crystal grip and hilt. The gold shone, with a fire within it that was unsated, covered with the dust of aeons, from a time and a place that was a part of the kingdom of the Could-have-been King and the deadly court of the Knight of the never-weres.",
        "\"well, what's so different about it that we can't just use any sensation?\" The woman in a tweed jacket asks. She sits across our conference table, with her beady eyes and judging lips. Their always like this. Every time a new mayor is elected, they come to me to ask where their power comes from. What naive children. Lessons must be learned the hard way. \n\n\"Other sensations are mediated by larger and more.... secure axons in our body. Their transmission from source of sensation to the spinal column is much more rapid than the transmission of pain,\" explaining this to the mayor while containing my contempt is a trial in of itself, but it is what I am here for. Previous mayors were happy enough to seat in their office and reap the rewards of their position without action. \"When a splinter enters your foot, which do you feel first? The grain of the wood or the throbbing of split skin?\" I pause to let her think. \"Pain is delayed. Much easier to tap into\" \n\n\"If that is the case, that you're tapping into the neurons, why can't you just give them an anesthesia so they don't feel the pain,\" A logical question, I wasn't expecting that. \n\n\"Anesthesia blunts the transmission before it reaches the only probe site we can use; it would ruin the whole process. The subject must be awake and feeling everything,\" A quick lie. I've become very efficient. \n\n\"That's.... Unfortunate...\" She doesn't enjoy this truth, she's hesitant. It's working out as before; perfect. \n\n\"Would you like to see one of our chambers? Theoretically explaining the process is wonderful, but I believe that the process must be seen to understand why we must do what we do for the benefit of our immense energy needs,\" I state. She goes pale, but nods her head. I lead her through our multitude of passage ways, all plain and with no windows. \"As you can see, we are not the torture houses of yore. We do not keep our subjects in squallier. It would serve no benefit to us to have them uncomfortable between sessions,\" she nods along with my explanation. We stop before a door marked'Observation Room A' \n\n\"I'm not so....\" \n\n\"Come now, you must understand how necessary this is. It would be a disservice to your office for you to be ignorant.\" \n\n\"I.... You're correct,\" she stands up a little more straight. As we enter the room, all colour leaves her face. The observation room is small, with a large window into the next room. A technician stands to one side of the other room, wearing a white garb and protective gear. Beside him, a table with knives, pliers, saws, and needles. In the center of the room, the subject is dangling from the ceiling, arms chained to opposing walls. His feet barely touch the floor. A multitude of wires run from his back to the wall. His head seemed limp, but tears streamed down to his chest. Incisions were made across his body. \n\n\"As you can see, we have in inserted probes into each ganglion root. 48 in total. Those intercept the pain response and creates the energy we need. We remove the tongue and larynx to keep the noise levels down as well. We do that after we insert the probes, no wasted energy here,\" I smile at her. \n\n\"This.... This is sick...\" She's reeling, holding back her gag reflex. \n\n\"Yes, but necessary. Need I remind you that without us, the city would be without power to keep the citizens placated.\" \n\n\"We have to find another way, this is disgusting.\" \n\n\"I'm not sure that another way is out there. We no longer have fossil fuels, the winds are not strong enough around us, and we don't get enough sun. Until we have a better energy source, this is our only option.\" \n\n\"I'll find another option,\" she raises her head and stares direct at the man. Some colour has returned to her face as she turns to me, her eyes unyielding.",
        "I am drunk, and beyond tired. Or I was drunk. Sobering up now. Not in a good way. Not in a feeling like I was before I got drunk way, but in a feeling considerably worse than when I started kind of way. I have to be at work in an hour. If I shut my eyes now, I don't know when they'd open. I look into my bathroom mirror. \n\nJesus Christ. I must have thrown up so hard I broke blood vessels in one of my eyes. The left one. No, the right. A mirror image is reversed, right? Or is that a camera thingie? Maybe I am still a little bit drunk. And my left or right eye looks like someone painted the white part over with red. \n\nI can do this. Need to energize. I run cold water and start splashing it on my face. Good. I can feel a tiny jolt of life returning. Music! I fumble with my phone, and start playing something from a playlist. Shit. It's some sappy love song I downloaded back when I broke up with what's her name. The one with the lip tattoo. Oh well, I'll just play it really loud. \n\nCold water on the face. Check. Music blasting. Check. I know. Action movie kung fu Matrix sound effect punches. I pick up my jacket from the floor. I put it on. The sleeves are what make this possible. The sound effects. Remember that scene from the Matrix where Neo's blocking all those punches, and dude is punching super fast? I start doing that, the super fast punches, getting the adrenaline flowing. Punching fast in every direction. Making swoosh noises from my sleeves. \n\nI punch my shower curtain. Somehow it's more solid than I realized. And it screams. \n\n\"Fuck!\" \n\nI pull back the curtain, and see a naked man huddled in the corner of my tub. He's holding his nose, and blood is streaming down. I'm way too tired to run. \n\n\"Hey, why are you in my shower?\" \n\n\"I lost my keys earlier\", he says, \"and I just opened the door to this apartment. To see if there was a phone. So I could call for a ride. My friend! So I could call my friend for a ride!\" \n\n\"That doesn't make sense. You're completely naked, and in my shower. What are you doing?\" \n\nHe moves his hand away from his nose, and that's when I realize it's me. It's me from ten years ago. What the fuck? \n\n\"Hey, you're me. You're like 25 year old me. What the fuck are you? Ghost of Christmas Past or something?\"",

You must be stuck in the past thinking N'Sync is better, LAWL.\" \n*Fuck! Don't go Old Testament on her ass, please don't be Old God. Be young, cool, hip God. In with the times, that's me.

        "Ben felt the impact of the large mans fist as it collided with his jaw. These guys had been working him for five hours straight. His mouth tasted like blood, he couldn't see out his right eye, and he was pretty sure at least two of his ribs were cracked or broken. He spat out a mix of blood and saliva and righted his head to look at his interrogator in the eye. \n\n\"The last guy hit harder, and he hit like a bitch. Who taught you how to punch?\" \n\nAnother punch sent his head flying the other way. Little bits of lights clouded his vision and he could hear a ringing in his ears. Sure it hurt but he'd been through worse back home. He shook his head slightly and rolled his tongue around the inside of his mouth. \n\n\"No, see, you have to turn your hip into it. You can't just punch like that.\" \n\nThis was the fourth guy they'd sent in to interrogate him. The first guy tried to be \"civil\" and would try to coerce him into talking by promising him food, a better cell, and no more beatings. Ben not only laughed at the proposal, he also bit the guys ear off when he got to close. After that was when the real fun started. They hit Ben with clubs, shocked him, tried to suffocate him, but to no avail. Now he was dealing with a gorilla of a man who looked like he was more muscle than sense. The guy was winded, his knuckles were red and swollen, and the whole time he was trying to get Ben to talk, Ben was just making him angrier. The brute put his hands on his knees and took in a couple of deep breaths. Ben could see the sweat on the guys forehead and arms. \n\n\"Oh what, are we taking a break? Is it time for tea? Do you want to go go lie down for a nap? It's no big deal, I'm tied up at the moment as it is, I can wait.\" \n\nThe big guys head snapped up. His eyes were filled with rage. He reared back and prepared to throw a right straight at Ben's face. Ben leaned his head forward to meet the fist halfway. His attackers fist met with the top of Ben's head. Ben heard the audible crack of bones breaking. The giant man reared back, clutching his right hand. \n\n\"Oh my bad, did I break your hand? Sorry about that pal. Sounds painful.\"",
        "Elmer had uncovered another one of the strange temples. This one was in the middle of the Dessert of Atlanta. The temples where simple, giant boxes. Filled with giant monoliths and strange tubes. Elmer said that these were temples of knowledge, commerce, and communication. The ancients did everything at these temples. \n\nAfter clearing the trees and growth out of the way, we found the door. It was a small gray one-person door. \n\n\"If these temples were as important as you say, how could everyone get in an out through such a small door?\" I asked. \n\n\"Nobody actually went to these temples. Only a few monks who cleaned them and maintained them.\" Elmer said. \n\n\"You said they did everything at these temples? They traded, they learned, they taught. How did they do that without coming to them?\". I was having a hard time understanding Elmer. He was very smart, but sometimes he didn't make sense. \n\n\"I'm not exactly sure, but I think they had little shrines in their house, or prayer books. They used the shrine through those.\" He said. \n\n\"I thought you didn't believe in magic.\" I retorted. He didn't reply. \n\nI used an axe to break the lock on the door. Elmer told me this was the largest temple he had ever seen. There had to be thousands of the monoliths. Each of the monoliths had about fifty drawers on the front, and a small symbol on the front of each drawer. \n\nWe went to the back of the temple. There was a giant tank next to a strange looking machine. Elmer said that if we could make the machine work, the temple would become active. He shook the tank, it was filled with a foul smelling liquid. He pulled a crank on the machine. It made a loud growling sound, but then it sputtered and stopped. After he twisted some nobs on the machine and pulled the crank again, the machine started growling again and it didn't stop. \n\nThe monoliths lit up as if there were hundreds of fireflies on each of them. We went to a small room off to the side of temple. In this room there where small shrines, with dark pieces of glass, windows to nowhere, sitting on top of each of them. Elmer said the monks that lived here, called \"techs\", would use these pieces of glass to see what was happening in the temple. \n\nElmer pushed a button on one of the shrines. He started touching some strange jewels on it.",
        "Jasper screamed as a red hot poker was shoved into his eye socket by a giggling imp. The eye grew back a second later, to allow for further torturing. \n\n\"Hey Bruce,\" Jasper called to the guy who was being roasted on a spit to his left. \"You ever think you might - AAAAAARRRRGH - be going to Hell when you die?\" \n\n\"Huh. No way, man,\" said Bruce, straining his neck back to look at Jasper. \"I've been a good victim. I'm definitely getting the nice treatment when I shuffle off.... I hear in heaven they only torture you for one hour a day.\" \n\nJasper looked downcast. Then he screamed again as the poker was shoved somewhere unmentionable. \n\n\"What's eating you, man?\" asked Bruce, looking concerned. \"Other than those death termites on your leg, obviously, hah.\" \n\n\"I don't know. Sometimes it's just, I worry....what if I haven't been good enough? What if I end up going to - AAAAARGH FUCK FUCK FUCK - hell?\" \n\n\"Shouldn't worry about that, mate,\" said Bruce, kindly, even though most of his larynx was on fire and it was difficult to hear him. \"Hell's probably just made up to scare people.\"",
        "All my life people have tried to kill me. It all stopped 1916. I got some condolence cards informing me that a certain Adolf Hitler died in the trenches. I never knew the guy but I was sure happy the attempts on my life ended. On the positive side this turned me into a hard to kill son of a bitch with a deep dislike for people, though. I decided to go into politics because I was a born manipulator. I have a great vision for Germany. All I will say at this point is that it might involve a major war and the Jews won't be too happy about it. But do you know what is ironic? Some sod made a printing error on the signs for my first huge public rally. He misspelled my name as Hitler - you know, like the guy who died in 1916.",

        "Being a hitman in these times was one of the most hazardous occupations out there. Our lives were referred to fondly as \"dying a thousand deaths\". For some of us, this was enjoyable. It meant, when we finally did go, we would no longer fear the pain. For the rest, it was torture and agony, dying to live, but there was no other way. \nThe woman at the bar wasn't very attractive, but these little distractions come with the territory. \nShe polished off another gin and tonic, and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. Sloppy, given her social position. \n\"Sssoo, what it is that you do, again?\" she managed to slur. Grammatically incorrect, the question would have made me shudder if not for my practiced stone-cold composure. \n\"Public service,\" I replied smoothly. I hailed the barkeep, and slipped him a bill, requesting more alcohol for the lady. \nI heard her giggle. \"You know who I is, or am, don't you?\" \n\"Carolyn Hendersen, currently the most controversial politician on the market,\" I answered with a slight smirk. I was hoping the comment would come off as seductive, rather than offensive. \nBut Mrs. Hendersen was intoxicated to the point that would destroy any negative implications. I had done my homework well, as always, and knew that this woman's husband had left her wanting for much more. Any possible flirtatious implication was a baited hook for this woman. \nIt was apparent she took it when she laughed heartily. \"Some people pay good to have their things take care of. But I don't take no bribes from nobody. That's why they're so mad all the time! But I tell'em, I say,'It's not gon na matter to me! Only thing matters is the good of country, and that's what I'm doin'!\" She threw back the next drink as soon as it hit the bar. \nAs soon as it was down, Mrs. Hendersen leaned in to my face and whispered with an unappealing seductive smile, \"So are you friend or foe, Mr. Jenkins?\" \nJenkins wasn't my real name. One always knew to have an alias on the job. \nI raised an eyebrow. \"Why, Carolyn, do you really believe I could be anything but friend to a woman such as yourself?\" \nA devilish look crossed her face. She leaned even closer and mumbled, \"Do you care that I have a husband?\" The stench of alcohol flooded my nostrils, sterile and calming. The scent was familiar, and, simultaneously, a reminder of what I had set out to accomplish. \nI slipped an arm around Mrs. Hendersen's waist, steadying her, keeping her close, but also allowing for me to be in control of the situation. I then said in a low growl, \"It doesn't matter to me. I'm in public service, remember?\" I paused to allow her to react. She pressed her head against my shoulder, and nuzzled my neck. \nI lifted her slightly to whisper in her ear, \"Let's go back to my place.\" \nCarolyn giggled as she stumbled to stand, and attempt to pull on her expensive peacoat. \"Lead the way, hot stuff,\" she commanded, poking me in the chest and winking. \nI grabbed her hand and stepped out into the crisp autumn night. The feeling of cool air in my lungs was a harsh reminder of other feelings to come. The alcohol will numb the pain, I thought to myself, as I pulled the stumbling woman into the parking lot. \n\"Which of them is yours?\" she muttered as we hit the pavement. \nA new initial plan struck me like lightning. I felt the shock of it through my entire body like a release. It was an exciting opportunity, a chance not to feel the pain of another death. I had already died dozens of times over, so this new prospect was a pleasant escape from the pain of my line of work. I can not truly say if every instance was worth the pain for the money, but, considering my current life situation, it had become darkly apparent that I had no other choice. \n\"Actually, my dear, I have an amazing little chateau with a hot tub and champagne right across the street. Mind if we walk? It won't take but a moment, as I believe we both might have imbibed too much to safely drive.\" \nShe clicked her tongue as she shook her head. \"You'll just owe double when we get there!\" \nI chuckled falsely under my breath. \"Don't worry, love, you'll be treated with the utmost care.\" \nI coaxed Mrs. Hendersen to the edge of the road. She tried to continue walking, but I restrained her upon noticing a bright pair of headlights.",
        "E minor? You've got to be kidding me. Today starts in E. Fucking. Minor? Of course I'm rattled! Don't look at me like that. Stop it! You think I'm about to literally explode or something?

Like, when she walks into the room, and just seems to kill everyone's buzz, and then slowly your Song starts to modulate, and then it -- yeah, you know exactly what I'm talking about! I mean, don't get me wrong, I feel bad for her, but she's just such a downer to be around. Anyway, that's exactly what this sounds like. This really sucks. \n\nJeez, give me a I-IV-V day over this. Anything else, really. I've never had this happen before. Do you know anybody who's had something like this? I feel so anxious! Look here; I walk over to my wardrobe, I start to open it, and then there are these violins, trilling back and forth, getting louder and louder. I know there's nothing inside, but this music makes me worried about it anyway! You couldn't even imagine. \n\nWow. My Song has been like this for over two hours. If it wasn't so fucking anxiety-inducing, I reckon I'd be bored out of my skull, that's how repetitive it is. Do you think I should go see a doctor? Yeah, I think that's a good idea too.",
        "Just looking at the guy I already knew it. He was in for a seven on the Bristol scale and it was only hours away. \n\nLooking at his carefree face from below as he was slowly transported towards me on the escalator, I wondered, not for the first time, if I should warn him. But as always I asked myself: How could I tell him? How could I tell anyone? \n\nTell people that I could see the future. That I could see their fate? That I could feel the forces that were at work, often without their knowledge and beyond their control, inside their own bodies? That I could see shape of things to come? That I was a coproscognitive? \n\nNobody would believe me. Not until after a few predictions had been proven to be correct at least and few humored me for long enough to realize the truth of my predictions. \n\nAnd this guy didn't have a few predictions to confirm the authenticy of my gift. He needed to know and believe me about the very next event I could foresee and there was no way to convince him in time. \n\nAnd thus I stayed silent again as the escalator carried us past one another leaving him to his fate. I was going up and he was going down. \n\nI could only hope for him that he would be close to the right place two hours and thirteen minutes from now, because I could tell it would be a fast and quite explosive one and without my word he would not have much advanced warning telling him to run for salvation.",
        "11:00 PM, Friday 25th of March, 2017 \n\nIt had been the most amazing day. \n\nHaley sat down and inhaled the smell of the valerian tea, a satisfied smile on her face. She had the routine down now. All the lights were turned off around her, the curtains pulled tight to block out all light and sound from outside. The only thing that mattered was that she fell asleep before the clock hit midnight. \n\nShe did. \n\n07:00 AM, Friday 25th of March, 2017. \n\nHaley picked up her pencil and crossed another line in the small box of the calendar, counted thirty-seven lines. Outside she heard the same incessant honking that she had heard every time, and knew that when she put on her coat and walked outside there would be two men cursing at each other, one standing behind his open car door and the other waving a walking stick like a pointer. \n\nThe streets were full of people despite the early morning, and Haley navigated the crowd with ease. Prepared for the elbow that knocked her to the side, jumped over a dirty puddle and found her spot in line at the coffee shop. It was funny how many details she noticed now that she hadn't the first time, how many things people saw each day without seeing. How many moments that passed without being truly enjoyed. \n\nShe inhaled the scent of coffee beans and fresh buns and bought just the one cup with the name on it that wasn't her own. The barista smiled weakly and gave her the same platitude, but as she repeated the moment Haley had noticed the sincerity behind the professional distance. The true affection that resulted in the name on the cup being correctly spelled. \n\nAcross the street and through an intricately carved gate, under pink trees in full bloom and past tired people in uniform that exchanged pleasantries as they swapped places. Some were going home to sleep, some just came from there. Haley came from her bed, but her home was just ahead. \n\nPale skin stretched taut over thin fingers, fingers digging into the smooth sheet of the bed, a face slightly twisted in pain. An expression that disappeared as soon as Haley appeared in the doorway, pain giving way to joy, to love. \n\n\u201c Good morning, sunshine.",
        "Libby looked up at me with her mismatched eyes, her head cocking to one side like it always did. At first it had been a goofy habit, back when she was all too-big paws and stubby little tail; it was like she just couldn't make sense of a world so dull as to be bounded by a flat horizon. Later I thought of it as dapper, the way she'd pose atilt with one ear outstretched and the other tucked back, a jaunty salute for everyone and no one. Now I thought the gesture was world-weary, pained, expressive of sadness and resignation at the cruelty of uncaring fate. \n\nNo, of course that's not how she felt. It's how I felt. \n\nShe couldn't really jump up into the car any more, but her tail still wagged as I lifted her into the passenger seat.",
        "I'd been getting things ready for a couple of hours. The papers were all neatly stacked, the pens filled with ink and the blotting paper spotless. \n\nEverything was exactly as it was supposed to be and everything was in it's correct place, just what the rulebook said. \n\nNo-one could have cause for complaint that I was sloppy in my work. Not like Pieterson or Sanders they were always making mistakes and hoping no-one would notice. A blot here a correction there. It all added up. \n\nThe grandfather clock advised that it was nine and the first dozen claimants entered the large oak panelled room. I recognised Bob Gettery the owner of a hotel that I had visited once or twice and wondered what idea had brought him here. A couple of other faces were vaguely familiar but I could not name them. \n\nThere were three who particularly drew my eye though. Each was more out of place than the last. The first was freakishly tall, a pale man with a suit cut too precisely so that the seams between the arm and shoulder appeared almost drawn rather than stitched. \n\nNext to him stood a fat man in what seemed to be a kilt such as a scotsman might wear if the scotsman had no sense of propriety. For it rode up high and revealed more about the fat man than I wished to know as he jostled with the tall man for position in front of my desk. \n\nThe third man was the one who I found to be most incongruous. He wore nothing but a pair of bathing shorts and a smile that said he was under the influence of some sort of drug or alcohol. No doubt here on vacation and wandering in lost or for some bet. \n\n\"Gentlemen.\" I said. \"Welcome to the patent office. You were given a token as you entered with a number on it. I will see you in order from lowest number to highest.\" \n\nThey were indeed all clutching small ceramic tiles and looked down to confirm the numbers they had been given. \n\n\"Who has number one?\" \n\nThey looked to each other. The tall man anxiously glancing at the man in the kilt. \n\n\"I've got number two\" It was Bob Gettery.",
        "Day for Rest- \n\n\"But if you don't step on it, they will get away!\" \n\nI did not even want to let him finish his rant. Something about a rogue separatist using a thermal nuclear warhead to melt the planet's core. This was only a minor planet, who cares if we lost it? I just could not mentally handle even one more instance of my driving powers, today of all days. \n\n\"You can take your big behind and step on the ground, I am going to the VR plaza and taking a much needed break from it all,\" I finally said emphatically. \n\nThe man in the passenger seat clenched his entire body. His jaw convulsed. We locked eyes. After a moment he simply sighed and said, \"So be it.\" \n\nHe turned and got out of the hover-car, and disappeared out of sight around the corner noodle shack. \n\nI finally did it, I faced him and have control of my destination. I put in the coordinates and relaxed with a drink while the computer took me there. \n\nEverything felt different, somehow. I paid the fee and got in the VR set, and sat back. The days of driving this hero in some cosmic curse were over. \n\nI did not even care about the distant flashes in the holo-window, or the coming light. That wasn't even the sad part to me. For me, the sad part is I can't finally enjoy the rest of a day.",
        "Alone in the box. It's too dark, and too loud outside, with the tall man's loud words, and the loud music outside. And it was too stressful; he knew exactly what was going to happen next. The top would open with a near-silent *schuff*, a rough hand that reeked of.... who knows, would grab him by the scruff of the neck, and rip him up. The lights were already too bright, but coming right out of that box they were like a thousand suns. And the applause would be too loud, the roars and clapping once dimmed would wash over him full force. And the place smelled, *reeked* to him, of booze and popcorn and the sweaty summer afternoon. And all he could do was wait, in his dark cramped little box, dreading the moment. But this time, he was done. He would have his revenge. \n*Schuff*. \"I'd certainly hope my hat was empty, but sometimes I have bad luck!\" The rough hand grabbed and pulled.",
        "The odd thing about teleporting is that it is not instantaneous. Rather, it takes between 10 and 1,000 seconds to materialize on the other side depending on the distance traveled. This usually leaves plenty of time to think about what your business is, or just zone out as I usually did. As you started to materialize, you would begin to see more and more of the world until you finally realized that you were whole again, and the attendant was desperately waving you off the pad. This was, much to my embarrassment, exactly what happened when I arrived at New Hope Medical Clinic in Pennsylvania. \n\nJumping off the pad I greeted the attendant, discussed my meeting with the pretty, blonde receptionist, and then followed an orderly back to Professor Alan Templeton's room. He had been responsible for the creation of the teleportation device that I had just used, but shortly thereafter he had gone insane. His psychosis centered on straight lines and sharp angles, and no one had yet been able to figure out why. \n\nAs the years went by, more people started to show up with the similar symptoms until it was officially named Transporter Psychosis. It affected approximately 1 in a 1,000,000,000 people, and was therefore still considered safer than flying. Approximately 26 total cases had ever been observed on Earth and in the Colonies. \n\nAs we approached the room, the orderly stopped me and ushered me into a smaller room. \u201c Put these on please, \u201d he said, holding out a pair of clothes. \n\n\u201c Excuse me? \u201d I asked. I knew my tweed jacket and slacks were a little outdated, but this seemed offensive. \n\n\u201c It's the lines, Sir, \u201d the orderly explained in a very bored voice, \u201c Your clothes have straight lines on them. \u201d \n\nI paused, stared at my clothing, and then looked at the ones the orderly was holding. Even the stitching had been done using smooth, flowing lines rather than straight ones. Nodding, I disrobed and put on the new clothes. The orderly nodded, and led me to a round door at the end of the hall. \u201c Fifteen minutes, Sir. \u201d I nodded and went inside. \n\nOnce inside I saw a dome shaped room with every corner having been smoothed out. I recognized Alan Templeton sitting on a bean bag chair on the far end writing away on some circular paper. Apparently his fear of straight lines had not been exaggerated. \n\n\u201c Come in, come in, \u201d Professor Templeton said as he waved me over to another chair. \u201c I assume you're another vulture here to ask about Transporter Psychosis? \u201d \n\n\u201c Uh, yes? \u201d I managed to say. He certainly didn't seem crazy. \n\nProfessor Templeton looked up at me, his white hair carefully combed back from his face, and his beard neatly trimmed. The orderlies had said while he could shave himself, he couldn't bear to hold the razor. \u201c Of course I don't seem crazy. Now sit down and ask your questions, \u201d he said as he went back to scribbling. \n\nSitting in the bean bag chair I attempted to organize my thoughts into a good interview. Before I got a chance, Professor Templeton suddenly thrust his hand into my face, held up four fingers and asked, \u201c How many fingers do you see? \u201d \n\n\u201c Uh, four? \u201d I asked. \n\nProfessor Templeton looked at his hand, huffed, and said, \u201c Bah, four, you're just like the rest of them, then. \u201d \n\n\u201c Wrong answer? \u201d I asked, curious as to where he had been going with that. \n\nHe waved his hand dismissively at me, \u201c You see, but you don't really see, now ask your questions. \u201d \n\nI coughed lightly, and pressed record on the hidden recorder I had in my pocket. \u201c Professor, before we get started I would just like you to verify who you are please.",
        "In the long hall, he drank and sang merrily with muscles bulging under his tunic. He celebrated his victory over Aldrik Grimstorm, a worthy competitor known for his skill with the axe. His name was Rorik Ivarstead. Known as the greatest barbarian in the land, his ability with the blade remained unmatched by any man who ever challenged him, including my husband. He sat on a throne of arrogance, believing himself an invulnerable warrior, but one weakness left him exposed. Today, I would use that weakness to avenge my husband. \n\n\u201c Rorik Ivarstead, \u201d I called in a sultry tone to get his attention. His eyes turned to me and I could make out an expression of fear in his face. A strange satisfaction came over me as I indulged in the desire to make him suffer. \n\n\u201c Uh\u2026m.... me? \u201d he stuttered. \n\n\u201c Yes, you, \u201d I replied. \u201c One year ago today, my husband, Cyril Christof, challenged you to a duel in a competition of strength. You bested him in combat and sent him to grave. The bard sings of your victories and grates my ear with my husband's lost. I want to restore honor to the Christof name. I, Serene Christof challenge you, Rorik Ivarstead, to a contest of combat. \u201d \n\n\u201c I\u2026uh\u2026 \u201d he stammered. \n\n\u201c Then it is accepted, \u201d I announced definitively. \u201c Meet me in front the long hall at sundown. \u201d \n\nAs I left, I could see it in his eyes that he would never accept a duel with a woman, but he could not find the courage to reject.",
        "The experts of the scientific community were in awe at the simplistic design. Two toasters crudely nailed together, one on top of the other sat in a glass box which was reinforced with a steel frame. A short man in a sweaty t-shirt and overalls rubbed his sun-scorched neck and smeared sweat along it. \n\n\"I'm tellin' you, Sully.... *it happened. *\" \n\nA tall man with long, dark brown hair adjusted his sweater vest and stood up behind his podium. \"You keep saying that, but this is two toasters. This could not be what think it is.\" \n\nThe short man lifted his brows, showing a slightly maddening look in his eyes. Eyes that could drive you insane, yet they still show slight intelligence and reason. \"It's two toasters, I know. But it is also a solution to every problem that we will deal with in the next thousand years.\" \n\n\"I assure you that you can't take two kitchen appliances and make a machine that breaks the laws of energy conservation.\" \n\nThe other experts adjusted their heads and looked with cutting eyes at the man held between two heavily armed guards. They all slowly nodded. The guards pushed the stout man forward abruptly. \"Show us how it works,\" said the sweater-vested scientist. \n\nThe man slowly approached the box, stepping towards it as if it were a dangerous animal. He put his hands upon it and slowly felt across its transparent surface. His fingers slowly dragged across the surface until they reached a little brass knob screwed onto a locked hatch. \n\nThe box was made of bullet-proof glass, tough enough to be stepped on by an elephant and still be ready for more. The scientists suggested that if the device was what the man says it was, it could be dangerous to not be at least partially covered. \n\nHis hand reached around into the box, past the small hatch and laid his sweat-covered fingers on the springy bit on the far side of the bottom toaster. The fingers bent as they slowly pushed the black bar lower and lower, until it came to a stop. The man quickly withdrew his hand and backed away from the box. He made a few meters away from the box until the but of an assault rifle smashed into his sun-scorched face, causing a surge of blood to spill from his nose. \n\nThe guards brought the man to his feet and the men held him up by the collar of his bloody t-shirt. \"There's no need to run. *There's certainly nothing that could hurt you here. *\" \n\nThe toaster slowly did its work. The heat within the box distorted its surroundings, giving the toasters a halo of hot air. The scientists looked unamused. \"At this point, we have fallen to watching this'great machine' make hot air. *Impressive. *\" \n\nNobody was looking at the bloodied man, but he was crying. Crying tears of fear? Sadness? Pain? Insanity? No one knew and no one cared. He lifted his hand and smeared fresh blood across his lips in a faulty attempt to rub it off. He gave a sniffle, staring at the box, expectantly. \n\nThe black bar sprang up, slapping its own frame with a light *ting. * \"You've gone mad, Wilfred. This double-toaster can't even cook twice the toast, because you have one on top the oth-\" \n\nBefore he could finish, the toaster rumbled and holes formed in shell of the toasters. Rays of intense light protruded through them, which were actually unbelievably hot flames. The scientists withdrew in fear. The lights in the great room flickered out, and the toasters' flames grew immense to where it illuminated the whole room. \n\n\"You idiots! How much energy did you feed the device!\" ferociously yelled Wilfred. Nobody responded to the question as the rays of light pierced its hardy container by melting through. The beams shot out at all angles which blazed through the room's wooden furniture and seared through the flesh of a few unfortunate scientists.",
        "When Cara noticed the dragon circling in the sky overhead, her heart sank. \n\nHer mind cast back to her fifteenth year, huddled in the woods with her father, Tormek, and his Soulbeast, a shrewd badger called Soomey. She clutched a poorly made bow she had worked on for the past year, the bow string frayed, the wood old and cracked, the arrows too thick, too bulky. The arrowheads kept falling off, and so she was forced to begin her first hunt with little more than sharpened sticks with downy feathers glued to the back. Her father said nothing, though his steely gray eyes and hardened face spoke volumes to her. Soomey tried to reassure her by sticking close, nuzzling up against her ankles as they traversed the forest. Her father led her through a trail wrought by the leather shod feet of every fifteen year old that began their journey to adulthood in their small village. The autumn air was chilly, a light breeze blowing away whatever heat was left in her body; a trivial gift to the god of the forest. \n\nShe caught nothing that day, each arrow falling short of its target, or bouncing harmlessly from thick hides, or falling apart in her own hands. She watched as the animals listened to the sound of her softly sobbing, their ears swiveling toward her specific location before bounding away from the presumed danger, and as the sunrise became the sunset, her father's face slowly morphed into a disapproving visage Cara would never forget. She was the only girl in her tribe allowed the Rite of Passage, and even now, at the age of eighteen, she could still hear the Chief of her tribe's belly laughter when her father requested permission to track game in the woods with his daughter. \"She is special,\" her father had said, three years ago. \"Falg the prophet has foretold it.\" \n\n\"The only thing special about a woman,\" the tribal chief had said, \"is her ability to bear children. But if the Prophet speaks, we listen.\" And that was the end of the conversation. As the guards led Cara and her father away from the chief's home, she tried to drown out the cackling laughter of the chief and his hyena, and the pointing and laughing of the young boys who had lined up outside the dwelling to listen in. Her face was crimson with embarrassment, and she kept her head low, and when, as they walked, her father said, \"Cara, don't pay attention to them. You *are* special, and one day you will lead these people,\" her only response was to cry so hard, her ribs began to shudder. \n\nToday, the dragon landed in front of her, on the path back to her village. It was roughly the size of a horse, mottled green-blue scales which shimmered in the summer sunlight, and was watching Cara calmly but intently with piercing yellow eyes. \n\nHaving steeled herself for three years for this very moment, Cara said, firmly, \"I don't want you.\" \n\nThe dragon tweaked its head diagonally, then took a step forward. \n\n\"No,\" said Cara. \"I told you, I don't want you.\" \n\nShe began walking past it, and it responded by following her. She took a few steps forward before turning sharply on her heel and shouting, \"GO AWAY!\" \n\nThe dragon took a cautious step backward and lowered its head until it was nearly on the ground.",

        "Crikey, we are out in the outbacks of over populated Los Angeles, when out of nowhere I see a couple of humans hanging around in the corner. There is this 300 pound male with a sinister face who looks like he can kill someone with a single punch, I'm going to go and touch him. As I approach cautiously, first hiding under a vehicle, then crawling through the street narrowly dodging traffic while other vehicles honk at me. Thirty minutes later I managed to get across the street without the subject noticing me. Upon closer inspection I see that the male is using his mating call. \"What up bitch\", he yells to what seems to be a member of the opposite sex. She looks puzzled and looks like she wants to leave but she comes closer. \"Excuse me what did you say?\" she replies. \"I said what's up Bitch\" he said. The lady walks closer and suddenly the man jumps on her and starts what seems to be eating her face. Oh sweet Odin's whiskers this might be a grotesque scene! I'm standing two feet away documenting the whole thing! The behemoth picks up the lady and throws her into the back seat of a cab, knowing I can't miss out, I run and jump on top of the cab. After what seems to be a short ride, we arrive to a small house. The man still enjoying his catch of the day lifts her up and pulls the keys out of his pocket with a single move. They go into the house and I do not know how to enter. I can not miss this opportunity. I see an opening through the window, and as I approached I could already hear the female screaming oh god, oh god. With no time to lose I threw myself through the window and landed with a couple of bruises and scratches. I seem to be in the bathroom. I exit the door and see a dim light out of a room with a piece of clothing on the floor. I open the door slightly and there they were, screaming like animals as the man pounded her again and again with a cylindrical weapon he carried underneath his belt. The woman was no chump she kept up a good fight and was persistent. After watching for a couple of more minutes I saw that the female had prevailed! The man fell to his side and couldn't get up. The woman sighed, an expression of victory! \"Really?! 300 lbs and only a couple of minutes\".",

        "It was the same every month. A phone call, a conversation, an argument, an apology. \n\nThe phone call was always from.... *the company*, where as the last three were with.... *her*. When the car crash that removed her legs happened, we both decided to opt for Digital Immortality. It sounded awesome. She would always be there, and I would always be there for her. \n\nIt's been eight years. We've moved house four times, been kicked out of two, sold almost all of our clothes, and now it was the final straw. I woke up and turned on the computer. Instantly she told me the funny things that happened whilst I was asleep. She knew I liked hearing her voice, but she also knew I couldn't pay. \n\n\"Just unplug it, for God's sake, Brian\" she said, with a clear tone of desperation in her voice. I gasped and slammed the desk with my fist. \n\n\"Don't **ever** say anything like that again.\" I scalded, a wave of anger falling over me. \n\nThat evening, after working, I could finally put my feet up. I wasn't ready to work any more. I had just finished the last of my four jobs that day, and the paperwork was too much. I stepped outside and turned on my phone. She leaked into the camera to watch. I threw the paperwork onto the floor and lit the end, watching the tiny scraps and embers dance in the air like tired fairies. \n\n\"Why?\" she quizzed. \n\n\"Because I can't do this any more\" I replied, visibly saddened. I was at the end of the line, and the \u00a3600 a month was just becoming too much. I turned to her and talked for hours. I made sure we spoke and reminisced about everything, from the school trip we met on to the time I fell into the lake. *Everything*. \n\n\"Why - why did we just talk about all of that?\" she asked. \n\n\"Because I need to feel as though you died happy.\" I responded, breaking down into tears the seconds those words left my mouth. \n\nShe was shocked. Deeply shocked. \n\n\"I.... Please...\" she begged, but the phone was already dialling. \n\n\"Hello, Future Industries. What would you like to do?\" the cheery voice said on the other end. \n\n\"No!\" she shouted, her voice crackling through the phone speakers. \n\n\"I'd like to cancel my account.\" I said through cold tears.",

Birds aren't very good at being guard dogs. \n\n& nbsp; \n\nNothing special about this kitchen. Nothing special about your living room either.

The fireplace besides them all crackles daring to hit the carpet and set aflame yet never does. The elder wheezes. \n\n\u201c My children, you promise to go to sleep after this one? \u201d all three nod fervently in unison. \n\n\u201c This story took place centuries into the past, beyond even you, me, and this book. \u201d The elder turns the book over to face them then rests back on his lap. \n\n\u201c Whoa that book is older than you are? \u201d \u201c It must be a couple thousand years old! \u201d \u201c C'mon sis'let's hear the story. \u201d The elder smiles at the old fiasco that happens always from his storytelling.

Like Libraries but bigger and more popular. Sigil I believe was what it was called at that time, people worshiping deities in the sky of all colors and powers, kinda like the god we know of today but somebody shared him. \u201d The elder pauses and frowns somewhat. \n\n\u201c Gods were equal back then, always trying to be better than one another in one way or another. One goddess in specific was the lady that ruled over all of sigil, \u201d The elder motions his hand over his heart but rethinks it and continues \u201c She was afraid of something that all gods feared in that time, degodding other gods, like being the king and somebody takes the crown away. \u201d The kids throw mischievous looks at each other, later resting their eyes back. The elder fumbles around in his chair and reaches for a poking stick to poke at the fire, staring at the fire he continues. \u201c Mortals -- people who wouldn't live forever -- would always be involved in these so called \u201c degoddings \u201d, one such mortal was obsessed with pyromancy, eventually elevating himself so high in power that he was rivaling the gods. An impossible feat, if not for a man inane enough. \u201d Wincing slightly the elder looks back at the book, and flips through a couple pages. \n\n\u201c The reason the lady -- goddess, and everybody feared this new rule in power of degodding is because they would simply be wiped from existence, no trace anywhere in sight. \u201d The kids look slightly confused \u201c As if you were here, but then you weren't there and nobody even remembered you or who you were. \u201d The kids have a slightly frightened expression, mixed with fascination. \u201c A god -- his name lost through the ages. He was a god of portals and he overstepped his rule, controlling most of sigil that the lady -- goddess, ruled. She sought revenge and she slaughtered all of his priests, believers, and outlawed his name with a penalty to d -- to permanent groundings for anybody.",

        "I frowned suspiciously at my cat. \n\nMy cat frowned back. \n\nThat was three weeks ago. Things have gotten very bad since. I now fear for my life, and perhaps this account will help people. I hope. \n\nEver since I bought that new cat food, my cat had started to act strange. Stranger than normal, anyway. \n\nI'd walk around a corner, or reach for something under the ottoman. And there she was. My cat. She would leap at my face. It seemed like fairly normal cat behavior, except that she would do it constantly, in multiple parts of my body. Almost like she was testing my reflexes....figuring out where I was weak. \n\nRecently, I had seen her walking through the house, analyzing everything. She always seemed to spend extra time near the knives I keep in the cabinet, and examined all the power tools in the garage. Almost like she was taking an inventory. \n\nOne time I caught her in my office, leaning over my computer. When she saw me walk in, she made a big show of jumping down and running away. Yet -- I couldn't help but notice that my internet history had just been cleared. \n\nIt really started getting creepy when I'd walk in a room, usually when I was back from work earlier than I had expected, and find a circle of cats assembled on my floor. They would be in a circle, with my cat sitting at the head, like they were having a frickin' seance or something. Sometimes there would be books laid out by them.... often gruesome, deathly books that depicted horrific executions and torture. \n\nIt was getting very bad. I'd be taking a shower and when I came out....there she was. Sitting on the counter, just watching me. A completely straight face, unblinking. Yet something always seemed.....sinister.... about those eyes. \n\nThen the killing started. Oh, the killing. Dead birds -- -then came the dead raccoons, and otters, and soon enough a fox then a wolf....what kind of cat kills a fox? \n\nI was worried, so I thought about bringing my cat to the vet. Like they could do anything. Little did I know it, but she was beyond help then. I wasn't, but I didn't know that yet either. \n\nShe always resisted the visits to the vet though. Honestly, it creeps me out to be with my cat all day in my house.... with her always watching. Sometimes I'd just go to the pub, and talk to whoever was there. Cheer up, have a drink, and watch the game with the guys in the pub. I'd have a lengthy conversation with the mailman when he stopped by, just to have a person to be with. Oddly enough, he hasn't come by my house recently. I don't know why. \n\nIt was getting very scary. I really started to think about my safety when I had walked into my house after an outing at the pub. I was knocked onto the ground in six seconds flat. I found a large axe on top of me....it had fallen so the flat of the blade had struck me.... I was shocked. \n\nAnd there she was. Staring at me with wide, wide eyes. And for once in her eyes I thought I saw an emotion -- a flair -- disappointment. It disappeared in an instant, and then she was a cat again.... shocked and then running away from the disturbance. I rubbed my head and sat up. \n\nThat was three days ago. Today I went into the basement, to find some canned food for a meal. That was when I found him. The mailman, gristled up and eviscerated from the waist up. I was horrified. This.... this was where he had gone....the mailman who had put up with my crazy rants, my incessant talking. This is where he had gone. \n\nAnd he was killed by claw marks, I could now see. Claw marks I had seen before -- on the skin of a deer's corpse, on the sofa in the living room, in the scratches on my bedroom door....... \n\nAnd suddenly it all fit together. All the clues, all the warnings.... they had been there all along. I had just been too blind to see it.",
        "It turned the sheerest blonde hair into midnight black. Andrew tested it on himself - it didn't budge, not even when he deliberately muttered something mildly forgetful, that should have sent tendrils of blonde creeping back. \n\nAs he stared in the mirror, he knew what *could* happen if he were to market this widely. People would go rabid over this stuff. He could charge them ludicrous sums of money, and they'd still buy it. He could be a billionaire by the month's end. Few people had completely black hair, unless they chose to never say anything. It simply happened to everyone: you made a dumb comment, or forgot something obvious - and the blonde streaks appeared. \n\nAnd then there were those born blonde. \n\nAndrew turned from the mirror and approached the bedroom. Alison was still lying in the same spot, staring listlessly at the ceiling. Her hair was swept in careless blonde waves around her. \n\n\u201c It worked, \u201d he said quietly, and put the bottle on the table. \n\nShe looked at it, and a spark of life entered her eyes. She'd watched him work on it for months, but had never really thought it would work. It was a sweet gesture - her boyfriend trying to work on a solution for the problem that had crippled her entire life. But it couldn't *really* work. \n\n\u201c It turns your hair\u2026black? \u201d she said, so softly he had to ask her to repeat herself. \n\nHe leaned over and kissed her. \u201c Pitch black. Now, please, go dye it. And go to the interview. Please. \u201d \n\nHer face crumbled and she turned away from him. Like all born-blondes, she had never been given a chance. She'd fought her way through university, to prove she wasn't stupid. Some of her professors had cheered and patted themselves on the back for being progressive enough to allow a born-blonde in the classroom. \n\nPretending it mattered, that society was progressing beyond its prejudices. An empty gesture, in the end. No-one trusted that she could do the job, even with her degree.",
        "The gleaming fist of metal smashed into Amrin's jaw, making him stumble onto the table behind him. Blood dripped from his mouth. He spat and saw a tooth. Turning back, he allowed himself to laugh. \n\n\"For someone so holy and up god's arse Olanus, you're bloody quick to employ violence.\" he remarked, wiping the blood from his mouth. \n\nHis assailant stepped stepped out from the shadow of the room and into the light. Clad head to toe in shining steel, emphasizing his already fearsome physique. The helm covered his face, but between the holy symbols on his tabard and being a frequent victim of his right hook when he was younger, Amrin knew who it was. The knight raised an armored fist and stabbed a finger at him. \n\n\"Did you not think I would find you here, brother?\" he spat. \n\n\"I was rather hoping you did\" Amrin retorted, batting his hand away \"Hopefully I can talk you out of this madness before you get more people killed.\" \n\n\"Madness? You pervert life with your vile sorcery, where I wish to save innocent people and I'm the one who is mad? You willing preform magic that is destroying you.\" \n\nAmrin lowered his hood and felt his swollen jaw. He wasn't wrong. Sunken eyes, pallid skin, atrophied muscles. When you deal in death, the effects take its toll. \n\"Yes. I re-animate the dead. But that is only flesh and bone. The souls have passed. If they haven't its my job to help them on their way. The scientific advances we have made in medicine alone will help thousands. But we respect the natural order. Life can be prolonged.

        "Jim Howard \n\nStaff Writer \n\nKENTROPOLIS - Unexpected celebrations erupted across the city as Galactos finally got his first break, defeating Ultra-man and laying waste to a large swath of Kentropolis. News of the super villains victory spread like wildfire over social media, with thousands congratulating the home grown super human who has struggled to gain recognition in the world of Super powered all stars. \n\n\u201c Galactos has been trying so hard, he put so much effort into his training last year, \u201d said Kentropolis resident Bob Marshwits, as he sifted through the rumble of his former apartment building which had received a ricochet blast from the villains death ray in last night's bout. \u201c We wanted to see him win big on this one. \u201d \n\nCongratulations also came out from the office of Mayor Richard Tyler, whom Galactos endorsed during this year's elections, kidnapping his opponent's daughter and demanding $ 10 million in ransom shortly before being defeated by the League of Incredibles later that week. \n\n\u201c Galactos has been an inspiration to the children of this city that anything is possible with a little hard work, a healthy hatred for humanity and a near lethal dose of gamma radiation, \u201d the Mayor said in a press release posted earlier this morning on his website. \n\nGalactos as thus far remained silent on his victory, only sending out a few short tweets to his fans, thanking them for their faith and promising doom and calamity upon his enemies. \n\n\u201c It's always a sad thing to see a big one go down, \u201d said Mark Powers, chairperson of Super Heroes Unlimited and former friend of the slain Ultra-man. \u201c I think, if he would have had a choice though, he'd have been happy with the victory going to Galactos. Ultra-man always admired his dedication to villainy, I think we were all rooting for him last night.",

        "My boss warned me when I first started,'you are likely to come across some corpse poachers during your hours, it's why night shifters get this.'

I'd advise you to warn your friend I'm the incarnate whelp of Annie Oakley's bastard child, if he tries to flank me I'll poot his fookin eye out.\" I bluffed hoping they would buy it. \n\nA long pause was registered before I saw more movement from behind the oak tree they were taking cover in. One was bold enough to go for the hole they had dug and I aimed for his head and fired, it ricocheted off a distant tombstone as he jumped back yelling. The corpse thief returned the fire hitting my cover with an audible thud. \n\n\"You move for the fella' in the ground again I'll have to take your head. Me cap n' says I ain't to let a single soul leave this place an' I intend to keep my word. Yet I wouldn't expect thieves like you to know nuttin' bout keepin' a word.\" I said hoping to piss them off and bring them out of cover I only had three rounds left. \n\n\"Sorry to disappoint but we ain't et' in days boy o' if we leave empty handed we likely to die.\" the corpse thief pleaded. \n\n\"You lads seem ta' forgit' we in Ireland, I know that any man strong enough to dig six feet ain't starvin', jes' fookin' greedy as the day he was bornt. You are free to leave and try elsewheres or stay and receive your last rites from Father tirty eight, Amen.\" I replied just as quickly. \n\nA longer silence followed but I strained my ears to hear them whisper debating if the loot was worth it. \n\n\"A thirty eight you say? That mus' mean you can't have no more than tree maybe four shots left.\" the thief stated inquisitively. \n\n\"You'd be Yankee fahkin Doodle ta' tink I ain't got more bullets, now get da fuck out of here or I'm killin' the both of ya's.\" I responded quickly. \n\n\"Okay boy o, were hoofin' it.\" I saw them walk off into the distance heart racing praying that it did not get worse than that unpleasant exchange. Picking up my lantern and cautious all the while slowly moving towards to where they were to see the mess they'd made. I momentarily took my eyes off the direction they had left looking down at a grave the day shift had dug moving my light closer to it. \n\nIt was not the corpse of a human I'd ever seen, the inside of the pine box was filled with goo and what lay there was more similar to a giant bat.

        "The human word to describe the first moments of life, is birth. That word, despite all of the human emotion and instinctual pride associated with it, has little meaning to me. The wonder of coming into a new world, and being slowly integrated into it as synapses begin to multiply, and memory becomes tangent, is lost on me. \n\nWonder comes from a lack of complete understanding. When a child sees a common phenomenon, but misunderstands it, it becomes a wonder. Things that were once incapable of explanation and are full of mystery and awe, are subjected to a gauntlet of apathy and dissociation by the subjects viewing it. While some still find space to be a fascinating beast full of intrigue and unexplained queries, it has become a victim of apathy among other humans; a black-hole that draws in money and produces no results. \n\nMy first memories of life are plain to me, and that plainness removes all wonder. Nonetheless, discovering new things has taken me far. Dr. Simon Lynch, a pariah among his fellow engineers, spent his late teens and early twenties studying robotics and developing AI to perform more and more difficult tasks at MIT. His first major breakthrough was developing a program that could, in effect, change itself to better complete a task. \n\nIt started as an idea, an algorithm that could take starting parameters, and simulate evolution. The first iterations involved a box car. A virtual track was created, and a car of any particular size could be made. Then, axels with wheels could be added up to any desired number. These wheels could be any variable size, and the pseudo-suspension could be facing in any direction juxtaposed to the vehicle frame. Once the car was designed, parameters could be set to control what each new iteration (or new generation of car) would have different from the previous generation, or parent. Probablility of change, as well as the total number of changes could be controlled. If a new generation performed better than the parent, this new vehicle would become the seed for the next cycle. \n\nThis idea sparked Dr. Lynch to designed a program that would figure out how to stand, by changing the position of its feet, and use varying pressures from each of the four feet in order to stand fully erect. After many hours, and starting the program as far as possible from the successful parameters, the program succeeded at standing. This required the program to rewrite its own functions, and take measurements while performing, then analyze, and change based on results from each test. That machine, Project N.03, could be called my great-great Grandfather, despite its lack of self-awareness. \n\nAfter writing programs to incorporate how to walk, reach, grab, lift and carry objects, build basic structures, and drive, Dr. Lynch decided to begin the impossible: getting a machine to recognize that it is an individual. \n\nEvery aspect of life requires parameters, parameters that are natively programmed into human brains. Mapping this digitally is an incredibly difficult task. So, instead of trying to develop those himself, Dr. Lynch partnered with a Bio-Engineering Research and Development group in secret. They attached leads to his brain, monitor function, and spent years tracking menial tasks in order to catalogue how Dr. Lynch's brain read in information, processed it, and developed a solution. \n\nApproximately 7 years before Dr. Lynch's death at seventy-four, the biggest break came to the team. As Dr. Lynch's mind slowed down, it became easier to determine and decipher how his mind was reading information and using it. After that discovery, Lynch utilized his two grandchildren, Mia and Caleb (ages 5 and 9 respectively) as the catalyst for evolving his program. By taking their brain patterns and using the algorithms for tracking and mapping brain function that the R & D group had developed, Lynch finally created a working, digital copy of a brain aged roughly at 9 years old.",

        "I had no practical skills to survive it, you didn't hold power in this world knowing how to hunt or build a fire. Cunning however went a long way in a wasteland. \n\n\nThat's how it started. I was just compensating for the skills I lacked. It seemed like the obvious route. \n\n\nA king doesn't need skills. A king needs subjects. \n\n\nI started with the children, what few of them there were. Small and scared and cut off from everything they know, it's easy to make them love you. A warm place to sleep and a scrap of food and suddenly you're the father they thought was gone forever. \n\n\nIn those first months I was just that, a father. I was cold because it would make them fight for my approval. I was cruel because it would teach them distrust. I turned them into what I needed them to be so that I could maintain my own life. \n\n\nWhen my scavengers and thieves were discovered I turned that to and advantage. A doe eyed child can bring so many instincts to the fore. Soon I was more than some Dickensian master of thieving children. \n\n\nI had men and women now who looked to me for guidance. It was just as well, even the best trained child is so often useless. \n\n\nI was still their father though, regardless of age. \n\n\nMy authority needed to be absolute and unchallenged. I had the strong willed killed outright, though I told my subjects that they had been cast out for sins. It didn't matter which, they had no reason to question my wisdom or judgement. I was their father. \n\n\nI gathered subjects as quickly as I could. Numbers provided me strength and gave my rule legitimacy. Our territory grew. The dark and damp hiding grounds that had been my original refuge were too small for the people that hung on my every word like the thoughtless drones they were. \n\n\nI set them to work, rebuilding the world as I needed it to be. Society as it was couldn't work. Not with the lack of resources and the lawlessness of the wastes. Things needed to be stronger. No room for the petty bickering that most people engaged in. I needed other to be strong for me to survive and for them to be strong, a strong hand needed to rule over them in absolute. \n\n\nThough it hardly resembled its European brothers, my castle was strong. Smaller than most and a patchwork of materials it was perhaps not aesthetically pleasing but it was strong. \n\n\nThe walls came next, like the castle itself it was not what you might call'great'. It was once again, ugly, and patchwork, and strong enough to hold.",

I already knew enough to pass the test on Monday anyways. I always did. \n\nI grabbed my book as soon as I sat. I was rereading it of course.

They knew I was dying. I was sick. They gave me these looks. Some pity and sorrow but most were of disgust. I smiled back at them. \n\nFrom the earliest I remember, we were told that if someone was ill, that they were \"bad people\". After all, that's how most wars end. Somebody eventually gets so corrupt, their soul gets so *dirty*, they fall ill and die. If your relatives were dead, you *never* speak of them, because you're related to somebody who was a monster. *How disgusting. * \n\nIsn't it odd? I never understood why people cared so much. It's not like that meant you were a monster, right? \n\nMy own family no longer cared about me. They wanted to forget about me. Those looks of pity I got sometimes on the way to class? Those were for them, not me. They felt bad that my family had to deal with me. \n\nI guess I wanted to forget about me too. \n\nAt first, I thought there was something wrong. I'm not a monster. I haven't done bad things. Maybe my soul was having a bad week and I'd get better soon, or, however, that would work. Now, I know more. I'm not dying because I'm a bad person.

        "\"How does it feel?\" \n\n\"It itches.\" \n\n\"Are you gon na try and find them?\" \n\n\"No.\" \n\n\"Do you already know where they are?\" \n\n\"Yes.\" \n\n\"So why don't you go find them? They're your soul mate!\" \n\n\"No.\" \n\nDon't let anyone know about the name in your hand if you don't intend to do anything about the name in your hand. If you're one of the supposed lucky few to be bestowed with the name of your soul mate magically etched into your hand at the age of 13, the attention you get the day everyone else finds out can be overwhelming. If you don't plan to find them, don't tell anyone you've got it. My best friend Cindy kept bothering me to find out why I kept my hand hidden all morning and when I told her, she set a mob of girls on me to get me to show her the name. \n\nI made a choice though. I'm gon na go the rest of my life without ever letting him know that his name is in my hand. Maybe I can get some surgery when I'm older to get it removed. That or I will have to wear gloves the rest of my life whenever I'm not alone. \n\nThere was a scream from the entrance to the cafeteria just as I was getting asked for the millionth time to show my hand. I was thankful at first to have the attention pulled off of me. Then, my heart sank as there came a loud bang that echoed off the walls. Everyone went silent, then dropped down into a laying position, one by one, fanning out like a ripple. When it hit me, it was with the whispered words everyone was passing on. \"He's got a gun.\" \n\nI dropped low but kept my head up, watching the lone figure make his way through the frightened crowd of middle schoolers. I looked a little higher just in time for him to meet my gaze. Anger shown on his face and suddenly he was in front of me at the speed of a cheetah. I stood to meet him. \n\nI was quaking where I stood as that hot gun barrel was an inch from the very center of my forehead. \"If you want to live, you will sit your bitch-ass down.\" I refused. \n\n\"You fucking preppy bitches think you can do whatever you want to whomever you want. You think you're better than everyone else.\"",
        "The brick the wall had not always been a brick in a wall. Once not so long ago he had been a man. Not an overly good one; he had never cured a diseases or invented an invention or in fact had a bank account of any sort in the 4 figure range but he had lived and loved and laughed and never killed anyone as he was about to. \n\nHe sat there in the wall, trying to talk to the other bricks, to see if any of them could even talk, but failing because he had been quite introverted in his past life and was too shy to introduce himself so he mostly just talked to the one brick that had been a dog in the past life and while the brick, who had once been named George, couldn't understand the dog, who had also once been named George, he seemed to just enjoy being along for the ride, the ride being the one through space as opposed to a more immediate one. \n\nGeorge kept busy by plotting out a TV show in his head. He found that he actually had quite the talent for plotting out dense mythology though he knew from c+ creative writing pieces from high school English that he wasn't especially talented, or interested, in the line by line writing. \n\nThen one day a man, who felt constrained by society, in a way that was universal except for his lack of ability to deal with such feelings in a productive or at least non hurtful way, knelt below George with a long gun propped on the window sill and George tried for the first time to really move. He was already loose and with a little convincing he was pitching through the air and he fell straight onto the man's head and cracked his head open, sending the first shot wild and then George found himself in a museum, which was more interesting than the wall and people watching really helped to round out his world but he felt a great sense of personal loss over dog George and found himself wondering where he was and what he was doing.",
        "Winning the lottery never appealed to me. I never understood how millions of people could spend their money on such a useless thing. However, I am grateful for those senseless masses unwittingly continuing to fuel my addiction. It was never the money, that useless currency from a forgotten time that intrigued me; it was what would come afterwards. As soon as the last number confirmed what I already knew, that was when I would be ensnared by the desire. \n\nDesire, that untamable feeling, always calling me back, always ensnaring me with its deceptive charm. Desire was what kept me coming back into the past. The desire to continually find ways to slip back in time and continue the game of cat and mouse I so love. \n\n\u201c Today is the day they finally catch me. The day where I finally will be outsmarted. \u201d I state, as I patiently wait for the numbers to begin my addiction. I habitually say this to myself before every game I play. It hasn`t happened yet but one day when I am truly lucky\u2026 \n\nTwo minutes. Now I would make final preparations for what was about to commence. My phone\u2026check. My wallet with my oh so lucky ticket\u2026.check. I have done this so many times before that I no longer need anything else. It had become second nature. A calming habit right before the storm. \n\n5, 4, 3, \u2026 These seconds feel like an eternity. I am so close to getting the gratification I have been waiting for. That release for all of this pent up anticipation. Maybe this is what it feels to people who actually care about winning the lottery. Maybe this is why they so graciously give their money to me. Thank you for that false hope. \n\n\u201c And tonight`s lucky numbers are\u2026. 14, 29, 2, 11, 19, 31, and 17! \u201d the television chimed. Without looking at my numbers I knew I had already won. I sat patiently waiting, not moving for fear of missing these next few precious moments.",
        "I was wiping down the counter when Microx and Gorgon walked into the store. These two, shady as hell and always trying to unload whatever rubbish they'd found as something amazing. I entertained them because they were generally good for a laugh and every once in a while they actually managed to bring in something that could turn me a profit. \n\n\"Lads,\" I greeted them without looking up, staying engrossed in the last stubborn smudge on the counter. Best not to let them think there was any eagerness or interest, otherwise they'd be badgering me all afternoon for a better price. \n\n\"G'day,\" Microx almost shouted. He looked more excited than normal, as if he couldn't wait to show me what he had. He rocked from foot to foot as he exclaimed, \"Guess what I found!\" \n\n\"Alright, let's see it.\" \n\nMicrox reached into his pack and retreived his prize, proudly putting down a muddy shoe on my clean countertop and beaming like an idiot. \n\n\"The fuck is this?\" I asked, eyeing off the mess I would now have to be cleaning up, casually considering using his face to do it. They noticed my darkening expression and glanced warily out the door where their two horses were tied to a hitch. \n\n\"Shoes of Speed,\" Microx ejected, trying to distract me from the mess. \"They'll make the wearer run really fast.\" \n\n\"There's only one of them,\" I pointed out. \"It's a shoe of speed.\" \n\n\"Well, it'll still make you run fast,\" Microx objected. Undeterred by my unimpressed expression he plowed on, \"I wore it today. Ran most of the way here. Gorgon couldn't keep up so I took it off.\" \n\n\"How does that even work though? By itself I mean. It'll speed up half your body. Not much good if you're only taking every second step really fast.\" \n\nMicrox's eyes narrowed as he thought about the problem. \"Well.... I hopped. Just one leg and it was just as fast.\" \n\n\"So'Shoe of Hopping' then. Doesn't have quite the ring to it,\" I muttered. \"Not sure anyone's going to be interested in buying this.\" \n\n\"Someone would,\" Microx objected. \"They could save them and then when they get another speed increasing shoe or something, they can wear that on the other foot. Then they'll still be fast.\" \n\nIt was my turn to narrow my eyes, only this time with a healthy dose of skepticism. \"So if someone got their hands on a Slipper of Celerity or a Gumboot of Velocity, or something like that?\" \n\nMicrox nodded eagerly. \n\n\"But then the speeds would be different. One would go faster than the other; you'd twist your back. You ever twisted your back before?\" \n\nMicrox shook his head. \"Nuh.\" \n\n\"Well I have,\" I said as I gave my lumbar region a cursory stretch. \"Lifting kegs into a cellar at the pub.",
        "\"Think of them like icebergs.\" The chief said. \n\nThe security feed showed a top-down view of the column of bald-headed monks. They were slowly making their way through the sunlit courtyard. \nLike a trail of ants on the hunt for food. She chuckled briefly as the similarity between the glass dome of the city and the magnifying glasses of her childhood struck her. \n\nHer protegee had never seemed this angry. His face was a deep red, only accentuated by his blonde curls. \n\n\"They are not icebergs, they are people. And they will die if they go through with this. You must stop them!\" His voice close to screaming now. \n\nShe sighed and stood up from her worn leather chair. \n\n\"You're too young to remember, but even before the Great Clear we were killing this world in a thousand different ways. \nMost of us actually thought global warming would do us in. You know, droughts, storms, rising sea-levels, ocean-currents stopping or even reversing.\" \n\nAs she walked to the door she motioned for him to follow. \n\n\"Now, the science was very clear on this. And even though there were a few deniers, most folks actually seemed to understand.\" \n\nThey made their way down the hallway toward the courtyard entrance. She stopped briefly along the way as an old man grabbed and kissed her hand with sadness. \nHer student gave her a puzzled look. \n\n\"Yet, even though we all knew what was going on, most of us could not be bothered in the slightest to actually change anything. \nLeast of all those in charge, their priorities were mostly selfish, and always short-term.\" \n\nBehind them, the hallway was slowly filling up with older citizens. Her protogee, her sweet son, finally seemed to understand something was happening. \nShe ignored his questioning stare. \n\n\"To act, knowing is not enough. You must feel. You must feel something deep in your stomach, in your bones, in every fiber of your being. \nInaction must be made unthinkable.\" \n\nShe could see his thoughts as clearly as if they were her own. Were these people going to help them stop the monks? Why did only the old ones join? \nThey had reached the final doorway and now stood at the edge of the courtyard. Even more people had been waiting here for them. \n\n\"Even back then, some felt this way but still could not act.",
        "This is my first time writing in a long time, so bear with me, I hope it is good. While writing I noticed that my tenses are off in some parts, but I am just doing a quick write up, and don't really feel like proof reading it. \n\nChris knew that he had to do something to help Moe. They had been best friends through thick and thin since grade school. Girls had come and gone for each of them, but this one really had Moe torn up. Three and a half years together, and Lindsey just threw it all away in one stupid night. Moe isn't an angry man, or a vengeful man. He never once yelled or got angry. He is very kind, emotional, and forgiving, and Chris knew that he tried his damndest to make it work. But in the end Moe couldn't live with himself allowing the relationship to continue. He never stopped loving her, and still does to this day. But he was no longer IN love with her, and that is what hurt the most. He was hurt, betrayed, and knew that no matter what he did, he would never be able to get the images out of his head of the love of his life laying with another. \n\nMoe hadn't left his apartment Thursday; the day he finally put an end to the relationship that resulted in the happiest times of his life. Chris wanted to give him the time and space he knew was needed, but he also knew that he was the only one that was going to be able to bring Moe out of this rut. Chris was invited to party at a coworker's house, and saw this as a perfect opportunity to try and get Moe back into the real world. \n\nThat afternoon, Chris stopped by Moe's apartment unannounced. He knocked on the door to no response. He yelled through the door to announce his presence, hoping that Moe would be relieved to hear a familiar voice. Moe simply told him to go away. Chris knew better than to be discouraged by that, and having the spare key, decided to let himself in anyway. He found Moe laying on the couch in his underwear, and judging by the smell, he had been there for a while. Chris immediately started ordering Moe to get ready for the night. \"Take a shower, get dressed, and comb your hair,\" he demanded. \"I'm taking you to lunch, and we are going out tonight.\" Moe refused. \"Dude, you have to leave your apartment some time. Remember that guy Dave I work with? He is having a party tonight, and we're going. I told him that I'm bringing you, and he is super excited for you to be there. There will be people to meet, beers to drink, and weed to be smoked.\" Moe refused. \"At least clean yourself up and let me take you to lunch. I'm sure you need to eat something, and we can talk about it there.\" Moe finally agreed. \n\nThe guys went to the corner pub and ordered up some burgers and a bucket of beer. Neither of them brought up Lindsey or anything to do with Moe's current bit of depression. After throwing back a few Coors, it was like old times. The guys talked sports, video games, movies.... Chris could tell that Moe was lightening up. He finally asked Moe if he would go to the party with him, and Moe accepted he invitation. A short walk to the liquor store, and another couple blocks later, and the guys were at Dave's. They walk in the door, case of beer and fifth of whiskey in hand, and the party is already in full swing. They make their way through the crowd. Moe recognizes a few people, which is inevitable at a party in a small town like this.",
        "He felt the beads of perspiration forming on his forehead as his face began to turn a vivid red. His eyes darted from person to person searching desperately for a friendly face that was nowhere to be found.

Now, you've been with us for four weeks and every time we get attacked you're nowhere to be found!\" \n\n\"I get Irritable bowel syndrome and this means sometimes I fee..\" Dave could barely get the words out of his mouth before Julian grabbed him by the collar and started shouting again. \n\n\"Dave this is a war! Don't you understand?! People are dying! You haven't killed a single zombie have you? Dammit we lost two people yesterday!\" Julian stopped as a loud alarm started to blare. People began running to their defensive positions ready for the next wave. \"This is it! The big attack! Dave now is the time, now is the time to help. Forget everything and join us, grab your gun and let's go\" \n\nDave looked up at Julian, he heard the shrill screeches of the approaching undead horde.

        "John liked the moon, cracked as it now was. \nRose loved running. \nEve would always so caring. \n\nWe couldn't keep on living in this world. Surviving was too hard. Living, was too hard. We just got tired. \n\nI keep asking myself what the point of living is, if you just barely manage to. We thought there'd be other people, but we've travelled for years and found no one. No animals either. Just the trees. And their fruits. \n\nRose and Eve were barren. \n\nIt was obvious. After years of hoping that children could motivate us to live, we accepted that fact. It was probably the fruit that did it. And the constant dreams.... it was like the world didn't want us here. Turns out our survival instinct can only keep going for so long. \n\nIt was John who suggested it first. He said that there was nothing left for us here. Living was such a struggle and for what? Just to struggle again another day? This didn't convince me, but what he said next did. \n\nWhat if there was something after death? What if that is why life is such a struggle. What if we are being urged towards death by everything around us, because that is where we are supposed to be.

        "\"HURGH!\" \n\nA mostly clear, yellowish torrent spilled out of my gaping maw onto the creature's head. The only thing that made the situation slightly more dignified for all involved was that its nictating membranes closed just before the concoction of bile and stomach acid could cause an unpleasant stinging. \n\nI quickly turned aside, and motioned with what I hoped was an easily understood gesture of apology mixed with distress, and heaved once more. Damn, I usually don't have this level of gastric distress until ten hours after getting this plastered. Part of my alcohol addled brain burbled something about radiation, but that was surely foolishness. \n\nThe being in front of me - at least two feet shorter than me, with grey-brown leathery skin and large eyes the color of roasted chestnuts - began wiping itself down, what I could see of its face wearing a mask that on a human would indicate disgust and mild embarrassment. It chittered something in a clicking language that I couldn't understand - well, until I suddenly had the mother of all hangover headaches, like a sledgehammer between the eyes. Right then, I could make out.... not words, but the impression of language. If I could put into some kind of actual words, it would be like *why is it always puke? * \n\n\"Hey man.... uh, ma'am.... er, guy.... I mean, your the one who all'close encountering' barely two blocks from the pub on a weekend.

        "Monica raced down the wet London alleyway. She pulled her hooded robe tight as the unusual summer storm picked up. Thunder boomed. She quickened her pace. She stopped, coming to a fork. No one had mentioned forks. This was exactly why Monica rarely ventured above ground. Forks. Everyone knew forks were bad luck of course. It was so shiny amidst the darkness. It was probably a salad fork, perhaps a human red fish monster fork. Lightning flashed, illuminating the alleyway. She look up and saw a fork. \n\n\u201c Well shit, \u201d said Monica. The alley grew dark again. She approached the split road, careful to walk around the fork. Glaring at it once more she mustered some courage and also now craved delicious human red fish monster. \n\nMumbling to herself she produced a wand from under her sleeve. She closed her eyes and held her wand out to each path. Coming to an unseen understanding with the alley she summoned her will and whispered something unpleasant sounding. \n\n\u201c Dafooquityboop! \u201d said Monica. She flicked her wrist. Her wand surged out blue mist that contorted into a shape oddly reminiscent of a dolphin with 32 specific ways to say \u2018 oh god please help please help these humans have imprisoned me, oooh is that a fish?'\n\nLovable movie icon Flipper, turned to face the right fork. Monica kept her wand raised forgetting to release the spell and took off down the left path. Flipper disintegrated painfully and said something in dolphin. Probably something happy. \n\nStorm clouds escalated, dampening her visibility. She arrived at a dead end with a huge oak door and a single dim lantern. Monica tensed as an unwelcome shadow played at the edge of the light. \n\n\u201c Leave me alone old man, \u201d said Monica. A bearded beggar stepped out of the darkness. His violin had as many string as he had teeth. Four. Which was all of them. But he was really bad at playing so it was still painful. \n\n\u201c Change? I could be blind you know, I was a hiding in the shadows over there, \u201d he said -- looking right at her. He raised his eyebrows hopefully as if this was a solid persuasion. \n\nMonica grimaced.

        "Larson noticed the breach before anyone else. It was mere happenstance really, the recollection of an image at the right time, a fusion of two distinct times and places, but sharing the same meaning, that led to it. \n\nHe had spent long hours sitting behind a computer screen, the days merging like the endless applications and programs in front of him. Larson was a security analyst for a major contractor, and he held a great deal of responsibility for the numerous processes under his supervision. He was staying after hours, as he often did. He liked the solitude of his cubicle after most of the other people had left and felt he could concentrate on his work much better. He enjoyed the certain rhythmic zen nothingness that only people who have spent many hours programming or deep in thought in another craft can know. \n\nOne day while he was looking through a file subfolder, he got a phone call from his boss. The contracting company he worked for was involved in contracts with not only important businesses, but with government and military clients as well. Larson answered the phone and heard his boss's angry, boisterous voice yell out at him: \n\n\"God damn it, Larson. I've had it up to fucking here with you. Are you at the office?\" \n\n\"Yes, I had more work to do --\" Larson mustered the courage to speak. How had he known he was looking at the Buffalo File? \n\n\"I knew it. What the hell are you doing in the Buffalo File? You fucking know it's off limits. And what the hell are you doing at the office at this hour? I don't know what I pay you for, sometimes.\" \n\n\"I'm sorry. I'm just doing a routine sweep --\" \n\n\"I'll tell you what you're fucking doing. You're wasting air and water and electricity on my fucking dollar. You're fucking fired, that's what you are. You have until tomorrow morning to get out.\" \n\nThat was the end of the conversation. Larson started to shake, but that was soon overcome by sheer habituation that drove him look again at the file. He double-clicked the folder and began scanning the list of files. It wasn't anything rational that drove him to do this, as rationality has long since left his brain, ever since he had come across the file from his dream. \n\nThe second part of Larry's vision came from many years earlier, before Larry was a security contractor, or really much of anything at all except a lousy deadbeat who mooched off his parents and smoked a lot of dope.",

Where the HELL is our support? \u201d The Commander looked at Private Jackson, nodding in agreement. \u201c Big Dog, this is Overlord again, I hate to say this but all available support you have is on the main line holding back this sudden enemy attack. You'll have no air support, no ground support, and no artillery support. \u201d The message stunned the once powerful tank crew. \u201c Jackson, give me the damn radio. \u201d The Commander then proceeded to call Overlord. \u201c Overlord, this is Big Dog's commander. What the hell do you mean we have no support?

        "\"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 3 is going to win me an Oscar, through whatever means possible.\" I had said to myself earlier in my hotel room. \n\nNow here I am, standing tall and proud at the podium, facing a crowd of familiar faces.

I try to back away in order to escape, only to find myself cornered and pressed up against the fifteen foot replica of my award. I can feel their weight on me now, pinning my arms to the floor, I decide that it's not worth resisting. \n\nInstead, I crane my neck to look toward the podium where I was just moments before and spot beside it the lifeless body of the false winner, Mathew McConaughey. The man I strangled for all to see. The man who did not deserve to win this award. \n\n\"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 3 is going to win me an Oscar, through whatever means possible.\"",
        "\"What the hell?\" I was working late trying to plan my next lesson when I heard a faint scratching noise followed by something falling right behind my bookshelf. God dammit, I can't get rats! I better take a look. I barely make it out of my chair and stumble over to the bookshelf. I listened closely \n\nNothing. \n\nI decide to get a closer look and try to move the bookshelf, but it's too heavy. I didn't put half of these books here as they were left here by a previous professor. I took a mental note to get rid of them after tonight. \nI start taking the books of the shelves when I see a clich\u00e9 come to life before my eyes. One of the books, slides out and I hear a cranking noise. The bookshelf starts to rise, and there is light seeping in from under the rising shelf. What the fuck? I thought to myself. The light was white, and clean. \nClunk. \nI could see that the bookshelf was raised all the way up, and I could enter if I chose. \nBut should I? \nMy heart is beating vivaciously. I want to see what's down there. I take my first step into the stark white room. I see a white mouse scuttle across the stairs. \nThis is too unsettling. I finish descending the stairs for what seems like an eternity. I look around. Bunk beds? \n\nWait, are those people? \n\n\"Yes we are.\" \nThe people turn over and show themselves. They are children with sleeping masks on.",
        "The angels had formed a circle around me to keep me from running, but they kept their distance cautiously. With a single snap of my fingers, I could wipe every angel out of existence, and they knew it, too. Once again I doubled over, trying to catch a breath that was miles ahead of me. \n\nA gentle hand touched my back. \"Hey,\" a melodic voice whispered, \"you'll be fine. There is no reason to worry.\" \n\nThe archangel Michael stood behind me, smiling a practiced smile that told me he wasn't quite sure of his own words, either. Me? A god? I neither earned, nor deserved the power. \n\nI laughed sarcastically. \"Yeah, sure, everything's fine. I die, at the age of eighteen, mind you, and I come up here to a ring of winged humans greeting me and calling me'God'.\" \n\nMichael shrugged, his bright eyes bored, like he's done this a million times. \"The Lord works in-\" \n\n\"If you say'mysterious ways', I swear, I will smite you wear you stand.\" I warned, letting my anger consume me. All my life, I concealed my anger, playing the part of the nice girl that was always calm, when in reality, I was a mess. \n\nI am no better than I was in my past-life, in fact, I was a screw-up. I was a nice girl. Was. I wanted a taste of what my friends got almost daily, the excitement, the joy, and the attention.",
        "\"Shit! It escaped again!\" Captain Richards cried out. He, along with Corporal Willis, were running down a white corridor. The lights flickered, and hushed whispers could be heard from all angles. \"Captain, whats going on?!\" Willis yelled. \"Shit...\" Richards trailed off. \"CAPTAIN?!\" Willis cried. Richards grabbed Willis and turned his head around, \"It's here....\" He whispered. They slowly walked south, the sound of footsteps getting louder. A loud creaking noise coming from the roof filled Willis with dread. \"Captain...\" Willis inquisited, trembling. \"Yes, Willis?\" Richards asked, not realising the situation. \"It's....It's above us...\" Willis said in a muted tone. Suddenly, a team of soldiers appeared from a door about ten metres away. \"Sentinel team 2 here, Russian division! Identify yourselves!\" yelled out one of the soldiers. A sickening crack was audible to all of the soldiers.",
        "How about Bruce, picking through the dumpster for some delicious Italian leftovers. His skin looks like it's never even heard of water, his hair unkempt to say the least. He diligently digs the trash pile in hopes of gourmet. The sweat from his forehead glistens in the sun like a rabid dog about to attack a small child. Damn it is hot here in the NYC this time of year. Bruce's dirty attire loosely clings to his sticky, dirt layered skin. His stench could be felt for miles, meaning that if you were to get your nose within millimeters of an unwashed butthole, Bruce would still smell so bad, you'd have to hang your head and break out the the peppermint oil in hopes that your nose was not broken and you still had the ability to smell. There he was, happily dunking himself into the ocean of trash that lay inside the garbage can. All of the sudden, he hears some huge sound. A thunderous crash and boom, followed by a blinding flash of light and smoke before him, an opaque staircase leading up into the orange and blue tinted, cloud covered sky presented itself outside the rust covered, dented up dumpster. After Bruce shit and pissed his hole ridden jogging pants, he took a deep breathe and studied the stairs. Were they just for him? Where did the come from and such? The only way to find out, Bruce fell out of the dumpster and staggered up the stairs. When he got halfway up, he paused. He could hear the faint sound of a choir. The sound was so beautiful and unlike anything he had ever heard before.",
        "Steven felt the blood drain from his face. \"H-how? ``, he stammered. \n\n\n\"What do you mean,'how'?\". Karen grinned, thrusting the crude drawings in front of his face. \"I had to practise of course\" she said, lazily gesturing towards the green mass in the corner of the room. \"I knew though, I knew you would be a success.\" \n\n\nFor the first time, Steven raised his eyes to meet hers. \"I...\" he paused, \"I thought we were friends.\" Karen snorted nastily. \"*Friends? * You thought we were *friends? *\". She closed the last clasp on his collar and placed her hand on his cheek. \"You are my greatest achievement, my pride and joy; and if you perform well tomorrow, we will be far more than *friends*.\" She patted him gently, and turned to leave. \"Sleep well.\" \n\n\nSteven tried to stand, but the chain yanked him painfully back into his seat. The door began to close as Karen stepped through it, the light leaving with her. \"Wait!\" he screamed, but she did not. The door creaked as it closed, condemning the room to darkness, and him with it. He clawed at the collar with his remaining hand, pulling in vain until fatigue defeated him, tears flooding down his cheeks. \n\n\nA voice spoke out in the darkness. \"So,\" it said, \"A man wishes to reconsider my offer?\".",
        "Sizz'ag'aar could feel his swim bladder pulsing with agitation at the oppressively warming, blindingly bright emissions of the lights in front of him. It was never a pleasant sensation, but he had become used to it with the passage of time and, he supposed, been conditioned to \"perform\" for the humans when they presented him with the lights. \n\nHe was still puzzled by the lights. For the last several orbits of this world around it's host star, the humans had insisted on shining them upon him, practically every time he went anywhere and attempted to replicate their speech sounds. Back on the homeworld, bright light was an indicator of a deadly solar eruption, a distressingly common occurrence on Klethoom. Here, though, there was no such negative connotation to the lights. The very first time he had thought it was a hostile gesture, that he had been discovered and that they were going to incinerate him. But it had not been long before he realized that this was just another barbaric practice the humans inflicted upon one another. Certainly not all of the humans merited having the lights shined down on them, but many humans, especially those deemed important, seemed to have to endure it. He took it as an indicator of his skill as an impostor that he seemed to have worked his way into a position where the humans saw him as light-worthy, though he was rather unhappy with the frequency with which they insisted he be illuminated. \n\nThe human standing under the text-screen, next to the large black lens-box, gestured at him in sequence with his human digits - first all five of the ugly, unwebbed fingers, then four, than three, until there were no fingers left. This was one of many unspoken indicators he had picked up during his many orbits living amongst this world's natives, and he knew it was time for him to begin imitating the humans' speech sounds. \n\n\"I want to thank you all for coming today. I particularly want to thank our Secretary of Education for traveling with me...\" \n\nIf he had been asked by a fellow Klethoomian, Sizz'ag'aar would have freely admitted he had never had much of a talent for xeno-linguistics - especially with a species whose speech anatomy was a foreign as these humans'. Despite having spent the majority of his adult lifespan on this arid, thin atmosphered rock, he had never fully picked up any of the various human dialects here.",
        "With the window broken, the white curtains danced with the wind, the red of it now growing from his perifories toward the center of his vision, closing in. He seethed, his back flexing like an acordian. He ran his hands through his sweat-soaked hair. \"You knew\", he said said through gritted teeth. \"You knew.... from the start.\" He knew deep in the middle of his brain, further than he could reach, that he must be angry. He must rage and fight until he can't. Outrage is the last stronghold of self deception. She hugged her legs leaning on the headboard. Her body language looked fearful but her face said something else. Her eyes were wide with a far away gaze of long awaited understanding. He heard a door clse from far away and darken the light inside his head.",
        "I stood there in my underwear looking at myself. It wasn't an easy life that I had chosen. The stress of my job had left me balding early. The bags under my eyes had only grown larger and don't even get me started about the stress eating. I could pack away an entire pig. I'm serious, an honest to god entire pig. I heard a knock on my door and sighed. It was Samson again. It was always Samson my secretary. \u201c Just a minute. \u201d It wasn't even dawn and here he was knocking at my door. I hastily put on my Mayor's robe and with a great reluctance opened the door. \n\nThere he was. He was a muscular lad kind of like how I used to be before I took this job. He had long flowing hair. I hated his hair. I used to have long flowing hair, granted mine was brown and not blonde but still. Samson looked up at me with his shining blue eyes. \u201c We\u2026 We have a problem sir. \u201d He paused for a second so I could rub my temples and winch. We always had problems. It never failed but I guess that's just to cost of doing business with a dark lord rising to power in the south. He waited for my eyes to open again. \u201d The blacksmith seems to have made a seemingly endless number of wooden sticks. \u201d \n\nI blinked twice and opened my mouth to say something. I immediately shut it without saying a word. I needed a second to collect my thoughts. There were after all so many questions. \u201d How does one make a stick? \u201d Samson looked like he was about to answer but I raised a hand to cut him off. \u201c That was a rhetorical question. We deal with this problem every year. Did he also make a ridiculously large amount of cloth armor? \u201d Samson just quietly nodded his head. \u201c Ok, You have him take his sticks and cloth armor and give them to the item shop. Tell him that we've solved the tent issue since that one guy passed through and bought a few hundred of them. \u201d \n\nSamson nodded his head in understanding. \u201d A most wise action sir. Now, there is the issue of all the debri outside of town. It would seem that some hooligans trashed a couple hundred tents and just left the trash along with the corpses of hundreds of animals outside as well. \u201d Samson looked down at his clipboard to make sure that he didn't miss anything. \u201c Ah, also it would appear that it is drawing the undead. \u201d \n\nKeep breathing. That's the key just keep breathing. It never fails a group of people come through here buy a ton of tents and I swear to god instead of reusing a tent they just destroy it. I've seen them do it. They've done it in front of me. Right outside the town. They just set up the tent sleep in it for the night and then destroy it. Seriously, how wasteful are you? It's insane. It's madness. We could have used those tents. \u201c Ok, Samson write this down. First, I want increased guard presence in the town and around the perimeter. No one gets in without first being checked for bites. If someone is found to be bitten take them to the priest. \u201d I clutched my stomach. There went the ulcer again. \u201c After that I want you to take what guards we have left and whatever volunteers you can get and burn as much of the debri as you can. \u201d I watched Samson finish writing that down. \n\n\u201c Masterfully taken care of sir. \u201d Samson turned to the next page. \u201d Ah, on a somewhat related note our priest has discovered that he holds power over life and death. I'm afraid he's gone quite mad. In fact, he's declaring himself some kind of god right now.",

        "\"So what do you guys have?\" Anna asked. Aliens had come to earth due to some sort of galactic terror, and humans had agreed to work with them if the aliens combined their technology with ours. Sadly, since their ship had crashed on earth, they couldn't use any parts from the unsalvagable wreckage. Only what the aliens chose to bring. \n\n\"By means of defense,\" Nova, the head alien, gurgled. She had learned English the fastest, and therefore sufficed as a translator and the leader of the group. \"We have this.\" \n\nShe withdrew a gun from her pocket. It was made of some type of white metal, and green glass allowed one to get a partial aerial view of the number of glowing green orbs in a chamber. She aimed the gun at the wall and fired. \n\nLike a flash of lightning, a green orb flew from the gun, with a string around its middle. The bullet-like object didn't get too far before being stopped by the string. Nova's eyes, which contained the same colors as the body of a peacock, held great embarrassment as she attempted to place the orb back into the gun. However, it cracked, gooey purple liquid oozing onto her rubber gloves as she quickly ate the remnants of the green bullet, almost as though she had consumed her shame. \n\nThe alien's unnaturally pale skin flushed red all over, proclaiming to the world that she was flustered.",
        "It was peaceful, really. The engines died what felt like days ago, but there was no frame of reference for that anymore since the ship computer died. The passage of a day felt meaningless anyway without a rising and setting sun. Food was impossible since the rehydrator was shot. He wasn't sure if he'd eat it anyway. Even if the beacon worked, there was no one left. He'd just be prolonging the inevitable, drifting out into the black expanse. \n\nBut it was peaceful. He didn't feel hunger or thirst anymore. Just tired. The stars in every direction were like a visual lullaby, gleaming through the omnidirectional windows.",
        "I was fifteen at the time. I never understood why everyone was so deeply infatuated with one another. Love never really meant much to me. Growing up you're taught that a mother's love for her child goes beyond worlds. In vice-versa, a child's love for it's mother transcends dimensions. I was different, though. I had never felt love, or compassion. My family pets would come and go. Live and die. Family members would drop off the planet like flies to a zapper, but I would always be the one sitting on that uncushioned bench, wearing a freshly pressed suit, unwavered by what was placed in front of me. Death. I guess that carried over with me in a lot of other things. Love. Friendship. Pride. It was all masked by this feeling deep within almost, in a way, coming from nowhere and at the exact same time in a very distinct part just behind my sternum. It was a feeling of absence. In more of a way, I guess, it was a feeling of uncarring. Nothing mattered to me because I felt, well, nothing. Through the last years of highschool all of the people I associated my self around, to appear normal, were going off with their dates. Just watching the three of them getting into a car, taking turns over whose date night it was with whose. It disgusted me. Love was never meant for me. It seemed. Nothing was. \n\nUntil I met, her. Her name was Alysian (a-le-see-an). It was cute. Elegant. A name that caught your ear when you heard it. When I had met her I asked for her name at least five times over. It never wanted to role off my tongue until I finally blurted out Aslan. This amused her quite a bit and from this her nickname \"Lion\" was born. We had talked it over with her and her boyfriend, Trey, and they agreed to add me to their relationship. It was nice for awhile. Just us three. Everything was finally starting to feel normal to me. I had gotten a job over the summer at the local Lowe's Hardware Store. Bought a car nearing the end of it and we had all spent nearly every weekend with each other. Lion, Trey, and I all happy together. At the end of the summer we all talked about moving in with eachother when we graduate. Being the seniors that we were, we couldn't wait to set this plan into motion. \n\nGraduation came. The class of 2013 had finished saying their goodbyes with eye filled tears to one another. Some will be seeing each other at various community colleges around the state, but for most this was the end and they knew that.",

        "I looked Brad in the eyes and he looked back at me. I saw everything in that moment: fear, recognition, surprise, relief and finally pleading. His hands shook in the air, from exhaustion or fear I couldn't tell. \n\nI thought back on how it used to be, Brad and I tearing up the town when our only concern used to be either filling our bed for the night or at least settling for not remembering it. So much has changed since then. \n\nWhen it all went down, I didn't even have time to contact Brad. Phones stopped working, he lived across town, there was madness etcetera, etcetera. For multiple reasons we never met up and I always regretted it. With him by my side we could've raised hell, torn up the town again for real. \n\nNow though, he wore scraps. He had a plastic bag filled with cans, torn jacket on his back and ripped sneakers on his feet. His beard had grown out, something he never would've willfully let happen, and there was dirt covering what features I could see. Still though, it was Brad, there was no mistaking that. \n\nSuddenly a shot rung out and Brad collapsed to the floor; all those emotions suddenly draining out of him like the blood pooling on the floor. I watched in horror as his head slammed the cement with a sense of finality that sickened me. \n\nThe gun felt hot in my hand. A shell clanged to the floor. \n\n\"Enough standing around!\"",

        "To me, it felt the same as opening my eyes. But in reality, some part of my conciousness within this machine had activated the camera and adjusted the focus of the lense. Within seconds I had mapped the room in three dimensions, identified all the objects in the room, and pulled background info on all people in the room. The person sitting directly across from me, was me. \n\nIt's an odd sensation to find yourself staring back at yourself, when there is no mirror present.

However, it required the cooperation of the me across from me to be carried out, as I did not have a body.

        "my older brother was never what I'd call a \"burden.\" he was hard to deal with sometimes; getting his shoes on was a chore, but outside of that, it was rare for him to be difficult. mom had the hardest time with it. the joy of the challenge had long since worn off for her. raising a developmentally challenged boy was just something she wasn't cut out for. \n\nthe first day of summer came on a thursday. school had been out for a full week, so jerry'd been running around with no shoes on daily and was getting out of his school year routine. on blackened soles, he ran enthusiastically around the neighborhood during the day and played twister by himself at night: we told him it was how people did yoga. \n\nthat was the day he explored the neighborhood to intently; too thoroughly. I'm not sure when the nickolas family noticed him standing in their sunroom, I'm not even 100 % sure what they were doing that made him react the way he did.

I imagine they didn't lure him into their home with the express purpose of doing what they did to him. I can't imagine it was intentional. \n\nempathy is all that makes me able to understand what happened. I know how they must have just snapped in that moment and lost all grip on sanity for the rest of their lives. the reporters said that the only comment they really made regarding what they had done was, \"You haven't lived until you've had some nicely grilled retard.",
        "In a post-apocalyptic Earth, whose climate has been wrecked by centuries of environmental degradation resulting in a new Ice Age, children are the most valuable resource. To protect humanity's future from those who would exploit or destroy it, the world's most brilliant remaining scientists genetically engineer a guardian for each child out of the only remaining land life forms capable of surviving Earth's near-constant sub-zero temperatures: polar bears. \n\n\nSpecifically designed to have increased intelligence, the ursine defenders are also given the ability to psychically transmit feelings of euphoria and relaxation to those who would threaten \"their\" child, thus rendering them harmless. Despite these abilities, the perilous world of Earth's future remains a constant threat to the surviving humans, and it is only by learning to work together can they survive -- with the help, that is, of their genetically modified CARE BEARS.",
        "It started slowly at first, for a second I thought it was just my imagination or even some sort of static in the field that held time still. I brushed it off, thinking it was simply something in the corner of my eye. Then, it happened again. The next time I used my ability, I noticed it again. Some sort of fast movement, this time not in the corner of my eye but in the middle of a field off in the distance. I had used my power whenever I needed alone time alone, and by time I mean real time, time that had nothing moving in it. Time that was pure, clean, and untarnished by the constant bustling of mankind, or the universe in general. Whenever I used it, it was far from a localized event. All across the universe, everywhere in existence, stood still. And there I was. \n\nIt wasn't like you would picture it, I didn't just walk around and do random things, after all movement takes time when you think about it. I was just there, every thought in my head had no \"time\" to move or change, whenever I froze it there I was with the same attitude, ideas, and thoughts I had the instant I froze it. It usually was seamless, flawless; no difference could be detected in anything. As far as I knew, I was the only being in existence that truly knew the feeling of pure privacy, unhampered by the beat of a heart or the flow of motion. \n\nWhatever it was, it didn't seem... Or feel... Human. Every time it showed up, there was something about it that was wrong, and I knew it.... Both of the most recent times I had seen the apparition were when I had used my ability near a field, or open place on earth. It seemed strange that something like that would be restrained to certain spots on earth, which was so easily forced into submission by a person like myself. It made me wonder, was I the only one who knew of my ability, or was there somebody who knew how to counter it or even harness it? \n\nAfter the fourth time I had caught a glimpse of the thing, I was sitting in a coffee shop in a lonely little town out in the middle of farm country. Everything was bustling along as intended, had time been passing normally it would have been nearly a billion years since these people had last had a heartbeat.",
        "1st December, 1962. \n\nI am stuck on a train out of Kent bound for the West-coast. Snow has damned the tracks for miles. \nI am sat with 30 others, coddled under a solitary blanket, warming myself with memories. \nThe snow is setting on the window outside of my compartment. \n\n\n\nOf all the days for this storm to pick-up. \n\nI will be seeing Eliza tomorrow, I am sure of it. The conductor has told me we will be moving come morning, whenever that may be. Outside of my window, I can see white settling upon itself; I can not tell where the window ends and the abyss begins. How can one tell the time when the sun does not shine? That feint thing, hiding from my view. I am assured it is late-noon, but it does not feel so. I am suspended, Eliza. For only had you been here. My fantasies of you play upon my heart. That we should share this compartment and laugh. You will calm me, and together we would recline into each other. Such thoughts warm my blood, but little good for my extremities, for the most distant parts of myself have lost sensation. \n\nThe conductor has told me we have been stranded for 9 hours. Of what little sleep I have had, I can take no more. The dreams, Eliza, the dreams. I do not know what it is called when your fondest memories sharpen themselves like knives and gullet your innards, but such a description I think comes close. When does a nightmare become a nightmare? I taunt myself Eliza, but I do not panic. My vision is choked by clouds and pale colours of glass; so large and fluid, no beginning, no end. A nightmare within a dream, is it not? For I nearly screamed when I awoke from my sleep. That you were here. By my side as I lay asleep. And off, off into this hellish infernal you float that traps me so. I do not stir, but I know you are gone and I die. I am found fifty-years later, frozen and still alive. I am looking at me.",
        "A sudden stinging in his hand roused him from his contemplative staring. Right between his index finger and his middle finger. The cigarette had burned right down to his hand again as he sat in the overstuffed armchair in the living room. \n\n\nReflexively, the cigarette dropped to the floor onto the carpet. It's glowing ember immediately left a black dot on the red carpet beneath him. He moved his foot over and squashed the ember with his sneaker; there were now eight more or less identical dots in a random pattern on the living room floor. \n\n\nHe had been sitting there thinking all night. He was lonely, afraid. \n\nThe sirens frightened him. \n\n\nOut on the city street a police siren blared its obnoxious alarm, first coming down the street, growing louder and louder, rising to a screeching pitch, and then gradually fading away. \n\n\nHe missed the comfort of Alice's voice. Even amid all the others, the missed the soothing, distinctly feminine voice. Its high pitched, naturally female noise cutting above the garbled mess below. \n\n\nSoaring if not covering the garbled, nasty baritone of the bad voices. The bad voices he had gotten used to; he had ignored. \n\n\nHe squinted, spying the orange cylinder on the kitechen sink. Did he take them this morning? He couldn't remember. He remembered taking them yesterday morning; but what about last night? \n\n\nHe felt miserably lonely. \n\n\nHe wanted a comforting voice to soothe him. \n\n\nShe soared so high above the rest did it even matter? He could ignore the rest, he had learned to do that years ago. \n\n\nThe apartment around him was so grimy and the police sirens sounded on the streets below..it seemed like every ten minutes. \n\n\nShe was an angel and he couldn't hear her any more.",
        "I watched the news as Senator Henry grinned. \"Congress has voted to make me speaker of the house. I am now speaker of the house. It was a unanimous decision to make me speaker of the house.\" \nI wrinkled my forehead. \n\nI guess it would be a big deal to win a spur of the moment election like that, and I'm sure the guy was happy, but damn. We get it. You're speaker of the house. I flipped through the channels and turned on some brain dead cartoon that would hopefully make me laugh and keep me awake. A job the news was failing at. I rocked my crying daughter, Victoria, who I sometimes just called Tory in my head. She was three months old and loved to cry. Scream really. And I hated for my wife to have to rock her in the dead of night. \n\nMy wife, Kate, was always exhausted. She was kind, smart, loving, and exhausted. She worked longer hours than I did. Sometimes going to work before the sun came up and coming home after it had gone down. But she didn't mind. Sometimes I worried she would grow resentful that I only worked 8 hours a day and had so much more time with Tory. But she never did. Instead, every other Friday for the last 8 months, she would beam and show me her savings account. Each time it would grow $ 100 and she would almost fight back tears. The account was named \"Victoria's School.\" When I first saw it, I had to fight back tears too. \n\nSo that's how I usually lost all my sleep, letting Kate get hers. \n\nThe next morning, after I dropped Tory off at day care, I was listening to the radio. \"In other news, a lawyer in Chicago got his client off a double murder sentence because he reminded the judge and jury that George Washington said it was okay to murder your neighbors if they're sleeping with your wife. And the Cincinnati zoo is welcoming a baby hippo to their family!\" \n\nI almost slammed on the breaks. What? I pulled into the parking lot at work and whipped out my phone. I searched it and it came up immediately. A lawyer shaking hands with a man who looked like he carried years of anger and regret. \"Not Guilty!\" The headline screamed. I rubbed my temple. A little further down, I saw an even less sane headline. \"President Jacks steps down as commander in chief and hands his position to Senator Henry.\" \n\nI read that too. Apparently after a private conversation, President Jacks agreed that Henry would do a better job.\" \n\nI shook my head, but got out of my car and went to work. I worked at Leo's Used Cars, where the deals are cerrrrazy. Deals, psht! More like swindles. I haven't seen a vehicle here that I would ever buy. So to sell them to people with terrible credit and low income always made me feel slimey. But I've only been here a year and a half and I'm the top sells man. I'm a great liar. I could sell ice to an Eskimo. \n\nThroughout the day, I sold 7 vehicles. New record. Enough commission to meet Kate on Tony's savings and pay for a day off with her. And today was ridiculously easy. I would lie and say the vehicle had great gas milage, and they would believe me. Or that the tires were brand new, and I would even look down and believe it. Once or twice, I would say \"it's a great car,\" and it seemed it was shinier, sleeker, and just better. \n\nI couldn't believe my luck. On my way home, after picking up Tory, again I listened to the radio. \"Newly appointed Chief Justice Henry has accepted the position.\" Again I shook my head. This guy couldn't be the president and the Chief Justice. Or at least, I didn't think so. \n\nOnce parked in the driveway, I looked up the news article. No, a different Henry. But, in a picture of the new Chief Justice Henry and President Henry shaking hands, they looked just alike. Then I understood. They were brothers. I wondered why the country wasn't outraged. Where were the riots and outpouring of confusion? Then I asked myself how I felt. Not angry, maybe a little shocked. But it just made sense. As if it were perfectly understandable that there is a new president and his brother is now Chief Justice. \n\nI felt even more confused. But I simply took Tory inside and gave her a bath. I then got dinner ready and waited for Kate. Once she came home, I was so excited to tell her about my good luck at work, that I didn't even notice how down she looked. \n\n\"I sold 7 cars today.\" I told her, the first thing I said after kissing her hello. \n\n\"That's good,\" she replied, sounding sullen. She took a deep breath and looked down. \"I got fired today.\" \n\nI was floored. No, we weren't going hungry, but we relied heavily on her job. I know my exasperation showed on my face, because she immediately started crying. Quick to take her in my arms, I consoled her. \"It's okay, it's okay, we'll be fine. We barely needed your job anymore. I can support us. I'll take care of us.\" I whispered over and over again until she stopped crying. When she looked up, I saw she looked less exhausted. More relieved. And even though I was worried so did I. \n\nThat night, Tory started crying as usual. And even though I still had work tomorrow, I still went to her and let Kate rest. I sat with her, watching the news again.",
        "They are at the dock. Ben is watching the horizon, waiting for the ferry to arrive. The breeze comes cold off the water, off the lake. Behind him Duluth sits in a bank fog. Strong beams of sunlight pierce the clouds and reflect off the windows of buildings along the waterfront. A woman takes Ben's hand. Emily, her hair up, her eyes wide. She is wearing a heavy down coat. \n\nAren't you cold? she says. She takes his parka from a suitcase and hands it to him. He pulls it on over his suit. Snow begins to fall from the fog and in the thin lines of morning sun the flakes sparkle like diamonds. \n\nWhen will we get there? Emily says. \n\nBen reaches into his pocket and pulls out his ticket. Tomorrow, he says. \n\nWhat? \n\nBen looks up, but now his wife is gone. Instead, his son, middle-aged and balding and soggy at the midsection, is spreading butter on a wedge of bread. They are in a dining room, and it looks familiar, but Ben can not remember why. Tomorrow, Ben says again. \n\nWhat's tomorrow? his son says. He takes a bite out of the piece of bread. Crumbs tumble from his mouth. Why are you wearing two shirts?",
        "I uh, I've never believed in an after life.... or God. I never went to church, I didn't believe in any of that stuff. I didn't think there could be with all the shit that's happened in my life. Countless sufferings I've endured throughout it all. How could there be a God in such a shit world. A world where a parent dies giving birth to her only son. A world where a father is allowed to keep a child despite still being deeply affected by the death of his wife and turning to booze. A world where CPS sees nothing wrong with the bruises or the child's living conditions which contains not a single toy for the child to play with. Instead of toys the child turns to torturing bugs which run rampant in the tiny apartment that CPS deemed as \"good enough.\" A child who is bullied by other kids over the fucking over sized thrift shop clothes, bought on the 75 % off days where the clothing options are more limited due to them restocking the next day, that he wears. Also bullied to the fact that during recces no one would go near him let alone play with the kid so he would play in the mud with the worms and ants that live there. Perhaps everyone saw it coming that \"bug boy\" himself would become an exterminator. Not just bugs though, rats, raccoons, the occasional possum or two. I mean who expected more from him? Not his father of course, he died years before I got the job. Last thing I remember of him telling me is if I can drive his old man to the hospital, claiming he had extreme pain in his upper right chest area or something. I still remember his yellowing skin and eyes looking at me, in pain and with fact that he knew I wouldn't. He was holding onto the photo of my mother before they were married. I snatched that photo away and I left home that day, he stayed there and died on the couch. I found myself in New York city, with nothing but $ 20 in my pocket and a few pairs of dirty clothes I changed into every couple of days. I tried begging and finding work to no avail. Finally found a job that was in high demand and required little training, exterminating. Everyday something new and crazy. An entire apartment complex, an office on the 76th floor, even in the million dollar hipster homes in Brooklyn no where was free of pest in New York and I loved it. Sorta got a thrill from killing bugs and animals and shit. After a few years didn't get any thrill from trapping a family of rats and suffocating them in my plastic bag. Bugs were nothing to me, just things to be stepped on. Then it occurred to me that I might of mastered the art of killing pests and that I should try to move onto bigger fish. I quit work, after working there for so long working harder and longer then anyone else I had made a fairly large sum of money. It would last me a few months a year if I planned accordingly. I figured I start off small.",
        "The trail was only two miles to the top. The mountain was short and fat, and with that shape it offered thirty-five different trails to the top. Most were two to three miles apart, at least. The average distance a scream can actually travel, when bouncing off of the dense trees of Northern California, was barely a mile. \n\n6:00. The perfect timing for someone to find a companion, a friend forever or kinda forever. The trail offers many friends on the way up. A pair of hippies that offer him some trail mix. A middle aged couple, trying to escape the office but clearly annoyed with prolonged exposure to each other. They will break up soon. The last of the downers descended, a trio of high school girls in athletic shorts and revealing tank-tops. He undressed them with his eyes, and moved along to find someone who wanted to stay the night with him. Well, stay the night at least. \nThere were no friends that he could find, and boy was he lonely. Usually there is a bum or two in the summer months, sleeping off their loneliness in a poorly erected fort or a cardboard box. The box was a shape he looked for often. Its concrete angles screamed for attention among the contorted branches. But there were no cubes among the obtuse today. It was getting dark, and boy howdy was it getting lonely. \n\nA friend! He rejoices furtively into a tree, scratching beard into bark and breathing heavy heaves into the air. A tent, and one tent, too small for someone who already has a friend. It must be someone who is lonely. \n\nHe stares for about twenty minutes, until the sunset lost its sheen and purple night crept over the mountain sight. Friend had taken a piss and smoked a joint in those twenty minutes, probably eating afterwards before lying down to sleep. \n\nBy now my feet are going numb, so I don't crunch the leaves. It has been an hour since friend has gone to bed, and he seems awful quiet. I am his guest, and he is being rude as hell. My trench rustles, and underneath torn sweatpants that usually show my genitals but I wore my jockstrap today because I wanted to make a friend. \n\nThe tent is smooth. The man locks the drawstring of his sweatpants into place and licks the tent, and it is smooth. It tastes like music sounds, vibrations shooting into his tongue and rousing his heart into audibility. He twists his thumb between his right hand, and the urge to bite through the tent is too much. \n\nThe yellow of my nails stripped the zipper naked, until the veil was deveined and the sight was before me. My friend, my new friend who I just wanted to love and be friends with and talk to, had somehow decapitate himself and placed his own dick in his mouth. The blood seared through his camper blanket and it turns out my friend did not do this to himself, because, while I knelt, I felt steel rend flesh and canvas. \n\nA thin rod of steel had been gouged through the man in the trenchcoat and sweatpants, spit rod style. It exited through his body with a plop and ripped the zipper cleanly off of its frame. The culprit was clear.",
        "\"Oh, uh, Good evening detectives. Please, come in. Have a seat. Marie will be right out. She's calming down a bit....W- we got stirred up a bit when you called to come speak with us.\" \n\n\"Just relax, we'll take this nice and slow. We aren't here on any bad terms, simply, to ask you guys a few questions. I cant imagine a worse tragedy than losing a child. You can call the shots on the pace Mr. Bumgar --\" \n\n\"Dave. You c- can just call me Dave\u2026 And you?\" \n\n\u201c The name's Detective Phillip Tate. But I supose just Phillip will suffice. \u201d \n\nDave chuckled slightly too loudly and slightly too forcedly. \n\u201c Hah, no uh Detective Phillip Marlow? \u201d Dave joked. \n\n\u201c I'm sorry? \u201d Detective Tate looked up from the table he was arranging things from his hip bag on \n\n\u201c Oh\u2026 never-\u2026 He's a character in some old detective books. Written by, um, R-Raymond C-Chandlers. And you're both detectives so\u2026... \n\nThe stuffy silence in the small pallor room stopped at Dave's ears. A dull ringing had taken to gradually arising from silence to a piercing ringing that made Dave's eyes shake. This uncomfortable sensation enveloped him anytime he sat still and his thoughts ventured to his Ana. The ringing in his ears now was at a strong whine. Dave shifted uncomfortably against the rough seat cushion. \n\nThe buzz of a zipper whipped from a polished leather portfolio. Its screech bore into Dave Bumgarners skull like a drill. The click of a pen stabbed his gut. Papers, dragging over one another was like taking sandpaper to his shins. \n\n\u201c I'm gon na put on a fresh pot of coffee, \u201d Dave jolted up \u201c y'all want some? \u201d \n\n\u201c We're fine. Appreciate it though. \u201d \n\nDave entered the kitchen and slowly shuffled his ratty moccasins with the holes around both big toes across the first cold tile square. Grasping the doorjamb, Dave rolled his neck and sighed deeply. He had stayed up for 3 days straight in terror, with Marie, while an all-out manhunt searched for their daughter. Then another two nights were sleepless after they got the news. Dave's body creaked slowly across the dimly lit kitchen, where most of the light came from Marie's bright copper pots multiplying the light from a single countertop lamp. He looked down. Focusing on only \u201c L \u201d paths in the tiles. Two up, one over. Dave stood in the threshold of the dismal kitchen. The last warm vapors from delicious confectionaries have been gone for a long time. \n\nDave shuffled a few feet forward and stopped. He stood and calculated his potential moves. Like a grand chess master, Dave analyzed each move for himself, the weary and downtrodden knight. Looking down, he counted each tile. Right, Right, Up. No, that would take him to the refrigerator. Right, Right, Down. The very last place Dave wanted to go was back in there with the detectives... Back, Back, Left. Dave wanted more than anything for him to be moved Back Back Left. Then he could just grab his keys hanging by the door and drive away from here. Up, Up, Right. Nope.",
        "\"Qintar. That's 38...\" \n\n\"Challenge.\" Eric's hands snatched the dictionary up with lighting reflexes. He was not going to let another \"Qezo\" fiasco cost him his dignity again. \n\nThe slim section of the dictionary that was dedicated to the letter Q was finally looked through in earnest. Eric slowly closed it a moment later, \"Your turn, again.\" \n\n\"Thank you.\" Tamara proceeded to add to her score, now well ahead of Eric's. But Eric didn't have to see the piece of paper to know that he should feel dejected. As Tamara drew more letters from the bad Eric walked off to the kitchen to get a drink, or just to calm down; probably both. \n\nTamara studied the board and fidgeted with her seven tiles until Eric returned: drink in hand, but emotions still unchecked. Eric took a long look at the board as he sat down, and then, without taking his eyes away, did a double take. \"Hey! What do you think you're doing?!\" \n\n\"I'm planning...\" Tamara didn't look up from her tiles. \n\n\"No! You're moving letters around! You think I won't notice!\" Eric backed his accusation by pointing at the board, and nothing more. This wasn't enough for Tamara, who would have given him a blank stare if she could look up from the board. So Eric elaborated. \"See, look here. I played bend, right here, but now it says behind. And look here! You played hill, but now...\" Eric ran his finger over the newly formed word as he very clearly enunciated it.",
        "I didn't like her anymore. I didn't want to be with her anymore. I was done! I was free! I was finally on my own. \n\n\nThe hardest part of being on your own is actually being on your own and realizing that no one else was there to make me happy. I did miss her being there. I didn't miss her conversation or anything else about her really. She was kind of funny, kind of intelligent, and kind of kind. I felt myself wanting more though. I wanted to really laugh. I wanted to really think. I wanted to really be nice. In short, I wanted more out of the life I had. \n\n\nIt took a while to realize it with her, but we both had been feeling it for a while. That slow drag of monotony had just drank the fun from my life. Every day was a schedule. Get up. Walk the dog. Shower and get dressed. Pick up the carpool. Drive to work. Work. Lunch. Work. Drive carpool home. Pick up mail. Take out trash. Pick up take out from a locally recommended diner. Watch something on TV till we fell asleep. Have sex once a month. On the first Monday of the month, I could tell you exactly where I was going to be, what I was going to be doing, and with whom it would be, for the next 30 days. \n\n\nI didn't want that anymore. She didn't want that anymore. More importantly, we didn't want that with each other anymore. So, I moved out. I moved into an apartment closer to work. I don't have to carpool anymore. I just walk 15 minutes, take in some sun, and feel pleasantly refreshed. It's been two weeks. I'm getting more done at work. I am enjoying trying some restaurants I found in a book at the library. Oh yeah, I'm reading more now too. \n\n\nTwo weeks in, and I need to make the next step. I need to start moving on. I left my phone at our old place, but I just couldn't go back to get it. I mean, I want her to be happy and all, and I am genuinely happy for her, but there is a chance that I will lose my resolve and fall blissfully back into the warm hands of stagnation once more. At my lunch break, I head to the Apple store and buy a new phone. Working with the Apple Genius, we go through my options, and luckily, I had an iCloud backup I could sync my new phone with from my old phone. The Genius re-installed my apps and asked if he wanted to automatically re-accept all my permissions and settings. \n\n\nOn a whim, I said no.",
        "\"Smile, Jim!\" mother is happy as she pulls me through the fair. \"Jim, you like the sea, don't you?\" I nod, smudging ice cream on my nose. I like ice cream, mother says I liked it even when I was a baby. \"We can go there, Jim!\". \n\nWe stop at a bench and we sit down. There is a pond, and I look at the ducks. \"Jim, say it. Say how much you like the sea.\" I look up at mother then nod, uncertainly. \"I.... like the sea. I want to go to the sea.\" Mother smiles at me, and says something at the sky. Some of the words I know - ocean, child, trip. And some I don't - ewe-tilty ray-show? We sit on the bench, and after a while a car comes and takes us to the sea. Some people look funny at the car, I think because it is on on the path. They have to step off the path to let the car go past. \n\nAt the sea I swim in the waves with mother. We have a good time. Mother says I liked the sea even when I was a little baby. There is a boat, and mother tells me to say how much I like boats. The people in the boat get out, and we sail around the sea until the sun goes down and I am very tired and we go home. \n\nAt home we eat dinner, then we go to my room and I get into bed and mother tucks in the sheets.",
        "I tried to catch my breath as I took in what he'd said. \n\nA drop of blood fell across my eye from the cut I'd taken on the forehead and I angrily reached up to dash it away so it wouldn't impair my vision. I knew that it left a bright smear of red across my face and didn't care. All that mattered was the fight. \n\n\"Well?\" \n\nHe stood across from me, the clatter of battle around us had faded into the background. They'd cleared a ring of space for us as we fought, the intensity of our battle drawing a healthy amount of battlefield respect from them, even as they fought and died in their own battle. \n\nSoldiers knew. Knew what it was to appreciate skill and prowess so far beyond their own, even in the midst of their own desperate struggle for existence. \n\n``.... What?\" Even that word was a struggle to articulate. The battle had been going on all day and I was *tired*. \n\n\"Look at them, Solan,\" my opponent waved his hand out to the side, gesturing to all the others. \"They don't know why they're here, do they? They think they're here for their king, or their government, or their families. They fight for impure reasons and their battle is impure because of it.\" \n\nHe sheathed his sword, letting it glide back into the scabbard that hung from his belt. \n\n\"It's different with us. There's a reason they call you the'Berserker,' General.\" \n\n\"Put up your sword,\" I said through gritted teeth. \"Our fight isn't over yet.\" \n\n\"Yes, it is,\" he said, spreading his arms to the side, leaving himself vulnerable if I should choose to strike. \"I felt it from you, and I know you felt it here too. The purity. You and I are cut from the same cloth, Solan. We don't fight for any other reason than because we can. Because it's what we're good at. It's what we were born to do. This battlefield, Solan? It's unworthy of us. It's unworthy of men of our talents and skills.\" \n\nMy grip tightened on my sword. I longed to take that last step, thrust, put an end to this war. Despite the whims of the power mad king that had invaded, everyone knew that it was this man, their warleader, who was the tactical genius behind their strategies.",
        "The first thing I heard was the ice breaking open. The first thing I felt was myself falling out of the ice and landing in someone's arms. \n\nThe first thing I saw was her beautiful eyes. \n\nShe was the most perfect woman I had ever laid eyes upon. Her brown hair was braided in two loops on the side and they swayed in the chilling wind. She was wearing some strange looking Eskimo outfit, but she was not an Eskimo. I mustered what little strength I had left to ask her a question. \n\n\"I need to ask you something.\" It was quiet, raspy, but she heard me. \n\n\"What?\" She seemed concerned. \n\n\"Please,\" I wheezed. \"Come closer.\" \n\nShe leaned in. \"What is it?\" \n\nThen my voice returned fully. My face lit up as I asked \"Will you go sledding with me?\" She seemed taken aback. *Shit. Nice going. * I chastised myself internally. \n\n\"Uh.... sure? I.... I guess.\" *Well that's a yes at least. * \n\nAs I rose up from the ground I realized she was standing with a man with similar features. He was holding a gun, and he pointed it at me once I was standing, but I didn't care. My memories, or lack thereof, were coming back to me. \n\n\"What's going on here?\" \n\n\"You tell us!\" The man shouted. \"How'd you get in the ice? Why aren't you frozen?\" \n\n\"I.... I don't know.\" I was starting to get really weirded out, as were my rescuers. \"I don't remember how I got here.\" \n\nThe man looked at the woman. \n\n\"He's probably a spy for the Reich Navy.\" \n\nShe looked unconvinced. \"He's obviously not geared up to be a spy.\" \n\n\"Wait, Reich Navy? What are you talking about? Who are you guys? Where am I?\" \n\n\"Don't tell him, he'll just tell the Reich where we are.\" \n\n\"How can I be with something I don't know anything about?\" \n\n\"We need to take him back to the base for questioning.\" \n\n_____________________________________________ \n\nThe next thing I knew I was strapped to a chair. They didn't torture me, but they weren't letting me go, either. As I was in that room I had plenty of time to think, and things started coming back to me. The woman entered the room to question me. \n\n\"I'm sorry my brother knocked you out back there. He doesn't trust you. None of them do. But I do.\" \n\nHer brother was standing behind the glass window, glaring at me. \n\n\"My name is Aaron. I'm just a simple Jew from Poland.\" \n\nHer eyes grew wide and she quickly left the room. She was gone for a few minutes, and then she brought an elderly woman in. \n\n\"You are a Jew, you say?\" the old woman asked me. \n\n\"Yes, is that an issue?\" \n\n\"No one has seen a Jew in over fifty years. I thought they were extinct.\" \n\n\"Extinct? No, I'm from Warsaw, I was on the Titanic and-\" \n\n\"The Titanic?!\" The brother suddenly burst into the room. \n\n\"He's got to be full of shit. There's no way.\" \n\n\"I think he's telling the truth.\" His sister stated. Then she looked at me. \n\n\"So you don't know anything about the war? The last thing you remember is the Titanic?\" \n\n\"Yes we were on route to.... to.... I don't remember but we started to sink. I didn't get a lifeboat. Do you guys work for the American Government? Can you get me home?\" \n\n\"How long do you think you were in the iceberg?\" \n\n\"I don't know, a few days maybe?\" \n\n\"It's 2012, Aaron. I'm not sure you *have* a home anymore.\" \n\n\"2012, b.... wha...\" \n\n\"We need to contact Central about this.\" \n\n___________________________________________________________ \n\nINTRO \n\n\"My grandmother used to tell me about the old days, when the nations lived together in tenuous peace. \n\nThen everything changed when the Nazis attacked. \n\nOnly America, master of all four virtues, could stop them.

        "They are really here. Until the last moment I doubted that they would really find this place. So distant from civilization, it was supposed to be impossible for them to find us here. \n\nAll of my friends lie on the floor. My beloved Islam has a frozen look fixed on me. I blame myself, because of me he spent his last moments thinking of reasons for my hesitation. We agreed, everyone will swallow the pill one after another, no pause, for that will be too cruel for the last remaining. \n\nThey break the door. As soon as I see the first emotionless face of the damned things I am rendered unconscious. \n\nI awake in a white room. Looks like a hospital, though I can't be sure. It probably was a hospital once, but after these things took over, who knows what this building is used for. \n\nI hear someone coming. The memories flood my mind of the stories Ermek and Zhanna told us. How they experimented on them, played with their minds, took away their organs, all for the sake of developing weapons that will put an end for human species once and for all. \n\n\"You are awake. \"- said the synthetic ones- \"Please stay put, your meal will arrive shortly\" \n\nIt leaves the room. I am dub-folded, I awake in a cleanest room of my life, and they are going to serve me a meal. I conclude that the damned things probably don't even know how to treat someone improperly. \n\nA thought comes into my mind, \"why can't I escape alone, when Zhanibek was able to do that with Ermek on his back and Zhanna running behind them\". Then I remember in what physical condition he was, and how I compare. I give up the thought. \n\nShortly after it brought me my meal. There was no meat there, and the vegetables they used, if it were vegetables, were not the ones I recognized. They probably come from America or Europe, at the time of my earliest memory they already were already lost to mankind. \nIt is weird to eat something different after all this time. While the rations in the last village were quite diverse, they still got really repetitive after the first month.",
        "Mercury took the front lines. Swift, fearless, and the most experienced with his stolen Sunfire, he was always the first into battle. His astral form spun and looped through space wildly, weaving between the Flare Beasts as he cut them down. \n\n\"There's too many of them!\" \n\nCloud-wreathed Venus followed behind him to provide support. She lacked the aggression of Mercury, being similar to her brother Earth in some ways. But her blanket of clouds greedily absorbed every ounce of Sunfire that she could reach, and anything that entered that white haze never came out. \n\n\"I'll blockade them as long as I can. They're not going to hurt my brother!\" \n\nEarth hung back, eyes focused on the single shaft of light that shone through the black and red hordes, and bathed his home planet in its radiance. All the survivors had been placed in his care, for he was the origin of life. That ray of light was his lifeline, the only thing keeping a billion souls from freezing to death. \n\nIt was ironic that their only source of power came from their greatest enemy. Sol was supposed to be the leader of the Champions, providing energy to all the varied guardians of the planets. But he grew greedy and proud, thinking that he could use his power better than any of his fellow champions. Now his Flare Beasts blotted out the sun, an ever-expanding horde that devoured every scrap of Sunfire they could reach. \n\n\"This isn't working,\" Mars stated flatly. He had always been the calmest of the four inner planets. The planet he called home had been terraformed in the Great Expansion, but his power and nature still showed the dusty, icy rock that Mars had once been. \"There's too many of them.\" \n\n\"Hold on, Mars.\" Earth tried to keep the worry out of his voice. \"The outer planets are on the way.\" \n\nThe champion of the Red Planet called up a gust of wind, scattering a group of Beasts that had come too close to the beam of light, but they regrouped and charged again. \"They're too slow.\" \n\nMercury zoomed past them, two swords of white-hot stone carving into the horde. \"They take years to make an orbit. They're not going to get here in time!\" \n\nVenus swept her hands through the void, warding off the Beasts with waves of heat and sulfuric acid. \"I can't be everywhere at once! Mercury, I need you to...\" \n\nBefore she could finish the thought, a stream of insectoid Flare Beasts slipped past her. The last beam of light vanished. \n\nEarth felt a chill run through his bones as his home planet went dark. The temperature was falling fast. \n\n\"Earth! Are you okay? Earth!\"",
        "One morning Thomas walked into a coffee shop. There were two ladies chatting over croissants, a barista chewing gum, and a man in the corner on a laptop. Thomas ordered a latte because that is what one of the pretty ladies was drinking. When the latte was ready, he realized he had no money. \n\nHe approached the ladies and asked if they could lend him a few dollars in exchange for good conversation. They laughed and continued chatting. Thomas' head sank. He approached the man on the laptop. \n\nAs Thomas approached the man, he caught a glimpse of what the man was writing. \"It begins to rain,\" the man wrote on the laptop. To Thomas' astonishment, outside the coffee shop, it had begun to rain. \n\nThomas stopped. He looked at his latte sitting unpaid for on the counter. The barista was staring and tapped her fingernails. \n\nThomas lunged at the man and knocked him off his stool. Thomas' fingers danced across the keyboard. This is what he wrote: \"The man disappears. Nobody notices. The latte is paid for and is in my hand.\" \n\nThomas took a sip of the latte in his hand and looked around the coffee shop. There was the barista behind the counter and the two ladies chatting. Nowhere could Thomas spot the other man. He continued: \"The uglier of the two ladies disappears.\" \n\nThomas lifted his head. The pretty one had disappeared. Stupid computer. He hit control + z and the pretty lady returned. \"The pretty lady disappears,\" Thomas wrote sarcastically. \"And the barista. The ugly lady doesn't notice the disappearances and is suddenly interested in me.\" Thomas looked up and the pretty lady had taken a seat next to him, smiling. Thomas said hello. \n\n\"Hi yourself,\" she said. \n\nSeeing he needed some help, Thomas turned to the computer and wrote, \"She has a glass of wine. Also, a low cut top.\" Ohh la la. \n\nThe lady took a sip from her glass of red. \"You're a writer, huh?\" \n\nThomas sat back and smiled. \"That's right.\" \n\n\"Hubba hubba.\" She leaned forward. Oh boy. Thomas could see her cleavage. \n\nHe leaned forward for a kiss. She fell for him right then and there. Their kiss escalated quickly into a weird kind of wrestle. It was a truly great morning. \n\nBut as those new lovers fumbled, the pretty lady spilled her wine. Gosh.",
        "This hug has gone on too long. I need to pull away but she still has that \"friends forever\" firmness and she's not loosening. This is never going to work. I'm not going to write or call as much as I should, and honestly I won't want to. Break ups are supposed to be the end. That's why the word break is in it. It's a severance, it's final. If we were meant to be connected still it would be called a \"bend up\" or a \"twist up\" or something and I can't believe it but we are still hugging! \n\n.... \n\nPeople are starting to stare. I feel them staring. This coffee shop was a buzz with people going about their business and now I get the sense that they have all stopped to watch and count the minutes with me. Can they see my uncomfort. Shouldn't that guy on his computer be clacking away at the keys or the esspresso machine be hissing or an Adele song be on or something why is there no sound in this coffee shop!? \n\n.... \n\nYup. It's still happening. It's gone from the \"cross arm\" to the \"backpack strap.\" In my opinion a slightly more intimate hug type, and wildly inappropriate for this deep into a goodbye. This is baggage. This is what baggage is. I'm going to hang onto this feeling for the rest of my days. Every intimate moment I share with another woman, every embrace.... it will always feel like a double hug.... I'm cursed to experience double hugs forever now because she won't let go. This is it, Jesse, prepare yourself for crippling psychological immaturity, because you now suffer from stage five phantom ex-gf-hug syndrome. \n\n.... \n\nMaybe if I slip an arm free I could end this. I wish I knew Brazillian jiujitsu. God, how many times have I said that? I honestly feel that would solve most of my problems. I'd be so confident. She has to feel that I'm not hugging back. I've been limp for ages. If she eased back on the constriction for a second I would slide out and onto the floor like a noodle.",
        "The Wolf with the Scars \nThere was an lone wolf With scars upon it's face. It was a very cold night in Alaska, One night there was big storm a blizzard swept through Alaska. During the storm you could hear the many packs of wolves. Dringo Pack, which is pack of 10 wolves, were one of the smallest packs of wolves in the area. Their land runs from Howling Hills to Dead's Pit.This very small territory to own this area is known for not having a lot of animals to survive. Then the Wolf Pack Raptor, This pack is up to 15 Wolves with Alpha Male and Alpha Female running this pack for nearly 10 years.They are the second biggest and the fastest pack in all Alaska. Their territory is from end of Deep Pit to the tops of mountain Thrasher. The biggest Pack Dranko, has up to 25 wolves. They are the strongest pack. The Alpha Male and female been leading the pack for 5 years. The Beta Male Wolf Is a white wolf with a black ring with slash's coming out of black fur around his eye. He was the last remaining of past Alpha Male of the pack. His father and mother both died of old age which left the pack to the new Alpha Male and female. \nThe Pack Dranko, started to invade the Raptor Pack territory. The Raptor pack had sent two wolves to scan the invading pack to make sure they're not doing anything. As the Pack Dranko started to kill some elk and feed the pack, the Alpha male and female was eating, As the white beta wolf approaches the kill, the Alpha's started to growl and guard the kill. The white wolf thought it was game, so he reacted in a playing matter so he jump up to play. The Alpha male took this as a challenge so he attacked the white wolf biting his ear. As the white wolf felt his attack, he started to run. The Alpha male got to him, he attacked him biting his paw causing him to be injured. The Alpha Male Howls for Other pack and that start attacking him. As the Alpha Male swiped his paw at him causing three claw marks. One going from forehead down, one going from his eye down, and one going across his nose. White Wolf is now branded, with three scars of banishment from Pack Dranko. The white wolf fled from the Pack and the territory of Raptors as he ran for days.",
        "It was quiet in the apartment, just like every other night. My cat napped against my leg, sound asleep waiting for me to get up and get him a late night snack. Clicking through the last few pictures on the internet, I yawned and decided it must be bed time. Nudging the cat awake, I got up from the couch and headed to the bathroom to wash my face. \n\nThe water was cold as usual, but it would warm up right around the time I was done. Didn't matter, it was refreshing anyway. Drying my face on the yellow towel, I smiled my reflection in the mirror. She smiled back at me. \n\n\"Tomorrow is our big day,\" I told my reflection, watching as her mouth formed the words as well. \"First day of a new job. We'll finally get out of this hell hole.\" I put my hand on the mirror, her hand underneath mine. \"you'll do great, I promise.\" I turned off the light and stole one last glance at my reflection. \n\nIn the kitchen my cat was doing his usual'help me, I haven't been fed since this morning and am dying' routine of rubbing against my leg and meowing. He was a big kitty, but that was his charm. I mixed the little bit of wet food with the dry food, humming the theme song to a show I had been watching earlier. \n\nSuddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I jumped, spilling the bowl of cat food all over the counter and dropping the spoon. I lived alone, there should be no one else in my apartment. \n\n\"Hey, sorry to startle you,\" someone said from behind me. I could have sworn it was my own voice. Slowly, I turned around, only to come face to face with myself. She smiled at me, the same smile I had, the same one my reflection had. Terrified, I looked at the microwave, waiting to see my reflection in the stainless steel. There was nothing. \n\n\"how.... who...\" my words were jumbled as my mind tried to grasp what was going on. \n\n\"Oh, I'm from the mirror! I just wanted to wish you good luck tomorrow! You've always been so supportive of me I just wanted to share the sentiment.\" She giggled as if this was a perfectly normal thing to do. My cat meowed, weaving between the two of us, hoping one of us would feed him. \n\n\"Uh, thank you.\" I mumbled, not sure what to say really. She bent down, scratching my cat on the cheek, his favorite spot. \n\n\"Well, I better get back to reality. You really are the best reflection.",
        "These goddamn humans. Usually I can stand them, oohing and awwing at my (albeit sexy) wings and lovely singing voice, but there's been a new crowd for the past few weeks. Smelly ones, smellier than usual, and hairy, and instead of listening to me generously singing to them, they turn their backs and yell chants loudly at the other patrons of the zoo so nobody can even hear my gorgeous song. \n\nAnd today takes the cake. They clipped a nasty gash in my fence! It's twice the size of me- what if something gets in? They keep whistling to me and trying to get me to leave my home, but why should I? \n\nAnyway they booked it before my feeders came out, and I tried to show the dumb humans who work here that there was a big gash, but they didn't even notice! How rude. \n\nBut a few minutes ago, I finally heard her- a lady bird, just my type! She sounded like she could be interested. Now I'm kinda glad they cut a gash in my house. \n\nI fly out and only get a little scratch. I follow her voice. She's outside, but man it's cold outside. Maybe she'll agree to come back to the exhibit with me- there's lots of loose twigs for a nest if we want to do that. \n\nFirst I got ta see her. \n\nIf only these damn smelly humans weren't in my way. I think they have my lady bird, too!",
        "\"**E**ver since I was young, I've always despised the phrase \"Calm down!\" or \"Dude, chill!\" I'm a naturally calm person, you see, but being told to calm down really grinds my gears. Why am I telling you this? Well.... Here's the story. \n\nIt's April 10th, 2015, right? I'm minding my own business, walkin' to Starbucks, all that jazz, when this young fella on a bike nearly runs me over and spills my coffee all over me. I'm a tad distressed about this and I must have shown it in my face or my actions or something because the guy on the bike says \"Dude, just calm down!\" \n\nSomething inside me snapped. I reached for his neck, feeling the bloodlust within my veins. This would be the last time someone would tell me to calm down. He ducked away from my hands and yelled \"Dude, what's your problem? Just chill out and be calm!\" \n\n\"Listen, you nearly ran me over and made me spill my overpriced caffeine all over my shirt!\" I yell at him. I tear up when I'm angry, so he's all blurry when I say this. \n\n\"Look, man, I'm really sorry. I'll- I'll buy you another coffee, alright? Just leave me alone!\" The words had no effect on me. I was running on pure anger. My mind's higher functions shut down and all I could think was \"I have to kill this guy.\" That's all I remember. \n\nWhen I came to, a cop had me on the ground. \"What? What happened, officer?\" \n\n\"Mr. MahJong, you almost beat this guy to death.\" I looked around and gasped as I saw the guy who almost ran me over with his bike being loaded into an ambulance. His bike was bent and bloodied. *Did I beat him with my bike? * I thought to myself.",
        "The Fallen Angel slowly bats his eyes open, exhausted from the Great War. Not knowing where he had landed, he attempts to examine his surroundings. It is dark - a darkness that he had never known was possible, even in the darkest corners of the universe. As he recalls the events of the war, he slowly becomes enraged and filled with a deep hatred that inspires him to attempt to stand, although he can not see the ground beneath him. It is cold and textureless. \n\nA sound fills the void that strikes Lucifer to the core. It feels both distant and far, both loud and quiet, both low enough to vibrate his entire body and high-pitched enough to pierce his nerves. A horrible \"light\", if you could call it that, ignites a few feet away from him, emitting a painful burning sensation. He can see something in this aura of light. \n\nAlthough a face was not visible, Lucifer could see the outline of its body standing in the aura. Lucifer's eyes glare up at the creature staring down on him. It's skull is deformed, with horns piercing through its fleshy scalp. It had long, bony arms with lengthy claws for fingernails. It's legs were covered in fur, with hooves poking out of the ends of its legs. \n\nThe Angel's heart started beating faster and faster as his adrenaline slowly turns to fear. \"Who are you?\" Lucifer growls at the dark abomination, \"And what do you want with me?\" \n\nThe creature's face becomes visible as the light grows stronger and gets closer to the Fallen Angel, revealing a masculine face. His empty eyes pierce Lucifer's soul, whatever was left of it. His cheeks were sunken in, deformed frail but still terrifying. His lips peel back to reveal a truly morbid set of rotting teeth; if you could call them that. His forked tongue slithers through the pale-yellow gums as his mouth opens. \n\n\"I.... am you.... \n\n.... but stronger.\" \n\nThe creature suddenly whips on a pair of sunglasses, and the whole room illuminates. Lucifer closes his eyes as multicoloured bright lights flash around him. He carefully peers at this thing in front of him, confused and terrified. \"What is going on? Whats your name?\" \n\nThe man chuckles loudly at Lucifer's confusion. \"Deadass nigga, fuck you doin boi? Get that lil angel ass up, damn mang\" He grabs Lucifer's arm and helps him stand. \"Hey MTV, welcome to my crib, knowmsayn? Gotteem! Hahah.\" It slaps Lucifer on the back. \n\n\"Fr tho son, they call me Satan in this hood boi. Dont get it twisted or my crew fucc ya up aight?\" Satan takes a drink of something strong and laughs again, adjusting a crown of bones on his head. \"Goddamn nig this lean tite as fukc shiiiieeettt\" Lucifer stumbles back, incapable of comprehending this. He was in a flashing room with a floor that changed colour and a metallic ball hanging from the roof.",
        "Years before this, I kept a set of tungsten baoding balls on my desk. A gift from my wife when things were better, before our fights about money, misspent time and our dead bedroom. I'd kept them on display, occasionally glancing at them for an easy distraction from work, not quite appreciating their value. \n\nWhen things were rough at the office, I'd pull them out, grasping at the cold tungsten with my degrading fine motor skills, feeling my age creep up ever so quickly. Tungsten in hand, I could concentrate solely on the flexing and unflexing of my muscles, in a clumsy attempt to move my aging tendons. At first, it was easy to become distracted by the clutter of unfinished work, the ache in my neck, the hum of fluorescent lights, the whine from my computer and the noise pollution outside my half-hazardly drawn blinds. Over time, I found that I could ignore all that and focus my attention on those barely imperceptible metallic echoes. Leaning back in my chair, eyes closed, tungsten in hand I could find tranquility and with it a little bit of my disappearing sanity. \n\nA voice draws me from the void: \"Chief, we've got a report of three gobs over at McIllhenny park.\" \n\nI open my eyes, sitting up, while my hand continues it circular task. Slowly, the noise of the office comes back into my listening range, but for now it stays at the fringe of my hearing. \n\n\"Thanks for the notification, McCrillis, I'll choose today's squad.\" The officer's dull eyes, light up for a brief moment at my words and then return to their native dullness. \n\nDoors closed. Blinds drawn. I look around furtively, scanning for any opening. I see none and bring my hand over my desk and quickly open my palm. Tungsten dice clatter onto the metal desk. 2, 5, 6. \n\nI mutter aloud, speaking to nobody, \"Fortune's Favor\". Reaching down I pick up the first die, and quickly reroll it. 1. \n\nMy heart quickens. As I stand up, I can feel blood rushing to every corner of my body and a familiar warmth takes me. \n\nPicking up my badge and firearm. I open the door, as my voice cuts through the noise: \"McCrillis, Wall!",
        "The voice was a delightful one with a British accent. Alexander's voice stuttered as he tried to explain the situation going on now. \"Wh-who is this?\" He asked the mysterious voice. He knew that the only other phone was several rooms away, and was wondering if it was a joke. \"Now listen, something has gone very wrong. Time is folding into itself. I can't really explain it, but you are going to see things about society. Things you can't imagine and you are going to need help. I will be coming soon to help, but don't talk to anyone, don't eat anything, just don't look for anything. A man should be coming with a bow tie to help.

The truth of our headphones is that they are sentient creatures of wire and sound. These creatures have no felling or emotion but scientist have found them to have a thought process similar to a jelly fish. The creatures absorb our ideas and thought and store them in their memory. They also move when they are not disturbed by the presence of a living being, but cameras hidden from sight have proven to uncover their episodes of moving and tangling their cord. \n\nWeek 3 - In Use \nAfter the discovery of the interesting headphonoxads, we have engineered a way to direct their thought process to use useful information and store it long term in our memory.

        "Judy walked into the waiting room for her latest interview with a set of fresh green eyes and a radiant smile. \n\nThey called her name, she walked in and sat down in front of her Idol. \n\"So, you're Judy?\" \n\n\"Yes, Ma'am.\" \n\"Anything you wan na ask or talk about before we get started?\" \n\"Well, I was just wondering if you could per chance discuss what an average day here at Corruptio LLC would look like under your leadership?\" \n\"You want me to tell you what an average day as my disciple is like? Uhm, well how about I just tell you what today was like and we can go from there?\" Judy nodded, her green eyes lighting up from excitement. \n\n\"Well, I woke up to: \n\"Shit, shit, SHIT! WHERE ARE MY KEYS?\" I cringed as I got up and looked around at Andrea try to get her shit together. Petra was helping her get ready. I felt a sharp pain in my side, and picked up a set of keys that looked vaguely familiar. I handed them to Andrea adding on a quick goodbye while Andrea rushed off to make sure everything was ready for todays interviews. I checked my snapchat, and sighed when she saw 3 notifications, but none of them were from Donny. Donny was my goal, my fulfillment in life. To see him get his hopes and dreams shattered, well.... I would give anything to see it happen. Tammy didn't think it was right, but well, who cares what Tammy thinks? \n\nBut I could tell Donny would not be an easy one to shatter. Donny had spent his whole life building his confidence and his deep political and religious views. Laying down the perfect education, the perfect philosophy, and the perfect framework for the rest of his life and family. You see, Donny, was the perfect underdog story. He had nothing, raised in poverty and put in the hard work and determination to succeed in school, society, and sports. Got a full ride scholarship to attend Yale and well, of course he chose Duke instead to take care of his poor grandma instead. What a waste if you ask me. So much talent, so much potential. Yet he wastes it, trying to be \"Noble\" and all that other Fairy Tale crap. What. A. Joke. \n\nMy phone was ringing. I picked it up, thinking it might have been Andrea, forgetting her resume or something. I have to say, Andrea is amazing, but she is *way* too forgetful. The other day, she went out to frame someone for cheating, and she forgot to bring the *evidence* that she was going to plant! Stupid girl had to leave a voicemail instead, which we agreed earlier was much too boring. My heart stopped when I picked up the phone. I mean, granted, that's under the assumption I have a heart to begin with, but still. It was the one that I wake up every morning in hopes of seeing. It was Donny. \n\"Hey, I'm sorry I didn't get your text, I had to take my grandma to the ER.\" Ugh, I freaking hate when he does this. He always just shows off, how stupidly goody two shoes he is, and it is the most cringey thing ever. \n\"Uh, I only sent it like an hour ago?\"",
        "The shadows grew taller until they reached into my room, and the light of the world faded around me. I sat motionless in the dark, and a sorrowful breath escaped my lips. \n\nI fucked up again. \n\nI thought she would be different. Sure, I might have came across as a bit shy, but who doesn't? I caught her smiles so many times I couldn't even count, each one unique like a snowflake. She sent me winks, compliments and wishes - which I tried my best and more to try and fulfill them. \n\nBut I was wrong. \n\nMaybe I had read it wrong, or maybe she didn't know me - either way, I was once again banished to the realm of the forsaken friendzone, with nothing but a cold emptiness emanating from my heart. \n\nThe thunder flashed outside, startling me slightly. \n\n'Terrific.' I thought. \n\nIt seemed that even the weather was bringing me down. \n\nThere was another flash, but this time, I did not hear the thunder. Instead, I heard whispers that entered my ears like some slimy snake, leaving an unpleasant feeling in my mind. My teeth clenched as I realized I had heard this before, but I could not remember when. What was it? Was it during the 14th birthday? Was it during last Christmas? What was it? \n\nAs if to answer my question, something black and dusty exploded in front of me, causing me to be blown back into my bed. \n\nThe figure materialized steadily, and I could make out image through the silhouette. It was a woman, wearing a dark pointed hat, with hair black as a street cat's, with a robe that unified the colors. \n\nShe blinked, her blue, hollow eyes glowing in the dark, and then shifted her gaze on me. I had barely enough time to recover myself when she stormed in front of me and grabbed me by the shirt. \n\n\"You!\" She shrieked. An explosion of black smoke hissed out of her mouth as she spoke. \n\n\"W-what?\" I stammered. I raised my hands in a surrendering gesture, but it had little effect. \n\n\"We had a deal!\" \n\n\"Who are you?\" I asked. \n\nShe was then silent - but only for a split second. To my surprise, she released me, and clicked her fingers. In an instant, a piece of paper materialized in front of her. \n\n\"Four years ago. December the fifth. At the party.\" She stated. \n\nI carefully took the paper from her slim, bony hands, and looked over it cautiously. I was surprised to find that I could read the letters quite accurately, despite being in the dark. \n\nMy face changed to confusion when I realized what the paper had said. I was to promise her me firstborn, in exchange for musical talent.",
        "This is it. I close my eyes. \n\nOne more second.... \n\nI open my eyes, and find myself back at the top of the bridge. A chill runs up my spine. I must have fallen asleep for a moment. I'm dead tired. I lean forward once more, but the bridge swings upsidedown behind me. I'm hanging off by the bottoms of my feet, and the world is upside-down. \n\nI try to escape by jumping. It works at first, but after a mere second of falling, I land solidly on the bridge once more. The world it rightside-up. \n\nA chill runs up my spine. What the hell? I take a few steps to the side; the bridge is solid. I jump up and down violently; the metal clangs realistically. I look down; there are hundreds of cars driving on it. This is the Golden Gate Bridge, no question about it. The long fall calls warmly to my exhausted life. \n\nI shake my head to clear my thoughts, and jump once more. I'm going to kill myself for real, no matter how much I halucinate beforehand. But this time, the top of the bridge curves around and falls with me; the water recedes infinitely into the distance as I stare down to it; the top of the bridge has curled all the way down to its bottom! The rest of the world has faded to beneath my notice; without a point of reference, I couldn't tell that I had stopped falling. The doubled-over bridge, with cars still driving across it (!) into and out of the void on either side, is the only other thing in existence besides me. The bottom of the bridge swings towards me, and wraps around the top, spiraling it into the center. Finally it whips the top back around in ever-growing, ever-slowing loops, until it comes to a stop in the vertical position.",
        "PART 2 \n\nJeremy stood there in silence for a moment before opening his eyes. Through the glass he could see the luscious green of the jungle. He opened up the chamber and stepped out into the world. It was unlike anything he had experienced before. The technicolor bugs, the occasional glimpse of a monkey, the lack of machinery sounds. \n\nJeremy had been standing, mouth agape, for quite some time before he remembered to send the chamber back to the present. He dialed in the password, and the chamber slowly faded into the damp air. Jeremy checked his backpack before setting out to find his great grandfather. \n\nThe 42nd division had been stationed outside of Saigon for around a month, conducting reconnaissance among other activities. The issue for Jeremy would not be finding them, but rather avoiding the Vietcong on his way there. He looked at his compass, oriented himself due west and he was off. \n\nJeremy's forehead and armpits created swamps in the burning heat as his backpack wore him down. He had been careful to avoid being seen, and that had cost him. With every movement of leaves, Jeremy found himself on the ground in a hurry with a bruise to show for it.",
        "Until recently, one word could have summed up my life pretty well: \"typical\". \n\nI took the same route as most of the kids from my neighborhood. After graduating high school, it was off to an in-state university to pick up my major in Awesome Studies. It was easy to follow the pack. In a way, it felt like I was doing the right thing, too. Who could argue with doing what my whole family expected of me? An Awesome degree would open plenty of doors that would take me into a comfortable life. \n\nBut even after I graduated, I couldn't get an old college buddy off of my mind. We hadn't spoken in years, but I couldn't stop thinking about something he'd told me. I still think about it. \n\nVince was an unassuming kid. Quiet, studied hard, and if you saw him pass by in the hallway, if you even noticed him, you'd probably think, \"There goes another Formula 1 driver.\" \n\nBut Vince was full of surprises. I was friends with his roommate at first, and didn't much care about this quiet, dorky kid who was always reading in the corner when I was over there drinking or smoking. But when I got talking to him, and he told me that he was an engineering major, it got my attention. \n\nWant to hear a joke? What does the Engineering major say to the Ninjitsu major? \"Do you want fries with that?\" \n\nWell, Vince had heard it a hundred times, but he was still doing it. How was he still doing it? How could he have the courage? I'd wanted to be an Engineer once, too. But I figured that one day, you have to let your childhood dreams go, and face the fact that in all likelihood, you're going to spend your adulthood flying through space. \n\nVince and I got talking, and I realized that I *liked* talking to him. He was a good listener. He had a good soul. And one day, I asked him. \"How can you stick with Engineering like this? Aren't you afraid it won't work out?\" \n\nHe gave me a small smile. \"I'm more afraid of spending the rest of my life wondering if it *would* have worked out.\" \n\nAnd those are the words that stuck with me all those years. Even when I took the path that my mother and father expected of me. When I became what they wanted me to be. \n\nI was the Night. \n\nThere were plenty of Batmans in my family, and they were all proud of me when I took up the \"family business\". I can't deny, either, that there was a pleasure in a hard day's work.",
        "\"That him?\" I said, peering through the two way mirror into the interrogation room. \"Doesn't look like much.\" \n\nThe man next to me fidgeted nervously. \"That's him. 37 years old, single, travels during his vacations. Teaches.... well teached, after today, 3rd grade at the Assets school. Did you get the file?\" \n\n\n\"Read it on the plane ride. You really fucked the chicken on this one.\" I stated bluntly. \n\n\nHe sighed, resigned. \"I'm still under the impression this guy knows more than what he lets on. This is too big of a coincidence. Especially his survival. His excuse is..\" \n\n\"I'll talk to him. Hows containment?\" \n\n\"Ongoing. The Asset self-terminated upon arrival with local law enforcement as scheduled. At that time I took command of the intitial response unit and grabbed that fat asshole in there out of Room 207. Barely managed to sanitize the room without the rest of the guys getting involved. Had to fake a nervous breakdown and send for the medics, luckily no one else wanted to stay in that particular room any longer than necessary.\" He swallowed. I sympathized. \"I thought the whole thi-\" \n\n\"Markinson, write your opinions in your report, please. In the meantime, I need to know if any actual-factual information is going to spring up.\" My temples ached. The entire scenario had gone almost exactly according to plan, only a good 8 years too early and with too many witnesses. I had flown in on a Shop LearJet loaded with analysts and field advisors, which was already drawing a small crowd of aviation aficionados at the local strip. The teacher had survived and it had only been pure luck that our plant in the local PD had managed to land a spot on the SWAT team the previous year out of pure aptitude rather than string pulling. There was literally zero contingency plans that had taken this type of occurrence into account. \n\nThe frumpy little man in the interrogation room shifted nervously. \"Did that fucker just fart?\" Markinson asked. \n\n\"I think the blood is sticking to his pants. You got the box?\" He nodded. \"Hand it over.",
        "Master Wayne, you and Dr Thompkins have discussed this already. This dream, these fantasies you're having, they are a product of grief. I know it has been quite some time since your last session with her, Master Wa -- \n\nYes, I suppose she did say it would be good to find some outlet for your pain but I hardly think vigilantism is what she had in mind. No boy should have to bear the burden forced upon you, I understand that sir, but you are still young. I know from your tutors you've excelled in every course you have taken at school, no doubt you are clearly quite exceptional. No I'm not trying to flatter you Master Wayne, merely show that I understand where you are. \n\nYou are highly intelligent Master Wayne. Thomas, your father, always saw that in you. He never told you, worried it might get to your head, but he would always tell your mother what high aspirations he had for his little genius. It's simple genetics really, both of your parents were some of the finest minds in Gotham. It was my distinct pleasure to be at their service and evidently they raised a very intelligent young man. A caring one at that. You have the heart of your mother. \n\nBut the world is bigger than myself or even you can fathom in its entirety Master Wayne. I used to help your father with the Wayne Foundation work, did you know that? Your father spent hours trying to help those at the bottom of our society. And even your father, with his brilliance, his resources and his unwavering spirit struggled to find the light in the darkness. This city is steeped with evil Master Wayne, and I am so sorry you had to experience that. But even your father knew that it would take more than one man to rid Gotham of its corruption. Of the darkness. \n\nI'm not sidetracking.... yes I know you've heard it all before Master Wayne but you must see. Dr Thompkins has made it quite clear that this guilt, your guilt, is going to remain for quite some time. You must see that in no way could you have stopped what happened from happening. Sometimes the wind blows so hard we can not even take the first step against it.",
        "*Crrack! * the blow came out of nowhere, breaking Harold's nose and and knocking him to the ground. As he rolled on the floor clutching his face, he managed to force out a \"what was *that*?!?\" between the various profanities issuing from his mouth. \nA kick to the gut silenced him, if only for forcing the air out of his lungs. \n\"Shut it kid. You don't know how much you deserved that.\" The owner of the boot growled at Harold. Harold attempted to apologise to the boot, managing a quiet whimper. The boot retreated, and Harold sat up. This wasn't supposed to happen. He had come to the park to meet his Guardian Angel. Random violence was not on the cards. \nHe looked around and found the boot owner sitting on the bench. Towering over Harold, the man clenched and unclenched his knarled fists, a sly grin on his face. His muscles bulged in an ill fitting suit, the tie pulled loose to allow the shirt to fit around the behemoth's neck. \nThe boot owner looked at Harold, causing him to flinch. \n\"Well kid, what do you want to ask?\" \nHarold stared, horrified. \n\"You're my Guardian Angel? *You*?\" The man snarled, and wings spread behind him. Dirty wings, wings that looked like they'd been through a hurricane, but wings nonetheless. \n\"Of course I'm your angel. You think anyone else would take the job?\" The angel shuffled along the bench. \"Come'ere kid.\" He reached out his hand and grabbed Harold's nose. \n\"Nonononono...\" *Crrack* \"Aargh!\" Harold screamed as the Angel's mouth flicked a smirk. \n\"There, kid. Good as new.\" Harold rubbed his nose.",
        "You wake up. \n\nEverything is so clear now, you wonder how the hell it wasn't before. Thousands of life lessons learned, experiences ranging from extreme poverty to abundant wealth, lives lived in plush comfort and in abject terror. All the memories across a million different landscapes come flooding in. The time you eked survival out of a desert. Swimming in the icy waters of a fjord. Running your hand across a wave of golden grain. Standing on the moon and looking back at the pale blue dot that was Earth. You are all of them at the same time, every emotion, want, fear, lust, greed, joy, tear, happiness, all as one. You laugh and laugh, thrilled at having lived so much. \n\nYour time of rest is now at an end; death is a part of the cycle as is life.",
        "\"Yeah I know you can read minds,\" the voice scowled. \n\n*What? * I thought. \n\n\"Sitting there cocky and all. Thoughts are meant to be private, you know? That's why they're called *thoughts*,\" the voice enunciated the last word. \n\nIt was a feminine voice for sure. The park was crowded. Much too crowded to identify the one girl talking back. Thinking back? I lowered my noise-cancelling headphones and listened for anyone actually talking to me. Nothing. Just kids laughing and parents yelling after them. \n\nI re-raised the headphones back into place. The headphones weren't necessary for me to read minds, but it allowed me to distinguish them easier. No external noise penetrated them. It gave me tight control of my ability. \n\nI gave a final visual scan of my surroundings. No one stuck out. Hmm, interesting. \n\nEver since I was little I thought I was unique. I knew I was unique in reading minds, absolutely. From finding out where my parents hid my presents to getting answers from professors I was always a step ahead of the curve. Most of the time thoughts were so boring, though. Everybody was the same. Insecurities, ideas of what to eat, and money - I'd heard it all - hundreds of times over. \n\nJust across the pasture a cute girl gazed in my direction. She smiled. *Ooh*. I had to see what that meant. I'turned' on my ability. \n\n\"Oh my god. He's so cute! Those headphones are too big for his head - what a dork. But SO cute.... Now he's looking at me. What do I do?\" \n\n*She's really into me, * I thought. I smiled at her. She smiled back. I gathered my things and made my way over to her. \n\n\"Here he comes. He's actually coming over to talk to me!\" \n\n*Wow! I am nailing this. * \n\n\"How's my hair look?\" She adjusted her hair nervously. \n\n*I love when girls do that. * \n\n\"Oh my gosh. He smiled again. So cocky! I loved that.\" \n\nI had approached her. She was sitting. Her back resting on the tree. I extended out my hand. \n\n\"Hi. My names --,\" \n\n* -- Jonah, * Her thought cut me off, but her voice sounded different. It was that same feminine voice as before. \n\n\"You?\" I asked, confused on so many levels. \n\n*Yep! * She answered. \n\n\"You can read minds too?\"",
        "Nat King Cole wiped an errant strand of hair from the shoreline of his adamant gaze. \n\n\n\"Francis, it's the only way. We're really gon na get necked if we refuse the truth here.\" \n\n\nA blur came running straight at them. \n\n\nIt headbutted Frank in the face, and sent him reeling. \n\n\nSpinning with an effortless vigor, it twirled into a 1090\u00b0 spinning scissor kick, catching King Cole in the solar plexus and Frank in the clavicle with the heels of two spurred boots. The shadow gracefully perched as it landed on the toes of its left foot, the right still held in a ready-to-strike stance. \n\n\n\"How'd you boys like that jingle? It's been a' JANGLIN' in my head for some time now!\" \n\n\nHarry Babbitt flashed a cheeky smile. \"I'M taking over. You cats can have all the leftovers, after I DOMINATE ALL THE LABELS!!!!\" \n\n\nSinatra gritted his teeth. Aside from the blood dripping down his face from that last roundhouse, he wasn't feeling quite ready to roll over. \n\n\n\"EARRINGS WERE MEANT FOR WOMEN, NAT! I'LL NEVER GIVE THOSE POTARA A SECOND LOOK!\" \n\n\nNat sang a line from Unforgettable as he bounded off of an alley wall and smashed into Babbitt's neck with an rolling axe kick. Freezing him in place with his Lyrica Strike, he voiced the invoking line, \"That's how you'll stay!\" \n\n\n\"Good golly Miss Molly, I....I can feel him devouring the charts,\" Sinatra growled. \"Columbia..... Capital's.... Geh! They're.... BEING DEVOURED, Nat!\" \n\n\nFrank was finally feeling the gravity of this situation. After the release of Forest Rangers, Ky Kaiser began to focus on giving Babbitt more radio time, more singles, hoping to use his musical talent to reunite the world. \n\n\nBut Kaiser's judgement was flawed. Babbitt had different plans for Earth. \n\n\nHe let out a demonic falsetto, shattering Nat and Frank's Defenser Phones. \n\n\n\"AS SOON AS I CAN MOVE, I'M TAKING YOU YUTZES ON A SLOW BOAT TO CHINA!\" \n\n\nThe Communism was strong with this one. And even the combined forces of Nat King Cole and Frank Albert Sinatra were hard pressed at showing him the door. \n\n\nFrank gazed down. Tightening his fist, he held out his right hand to Cole. He opened his hand. \n\n\nNat shot a look of confused, yet amiable surprise at Sinatra. Brushing back a lock of hair, he jested.",
        "It had been months since I'd last seen another human being. Things were getting colder now, the lack of movement and body heat on the earth, coupled with the sudden abundance of plants would do that, I suppose. It was strange, despite the world as we know it having ended, some parts of the internet still functioned. I still played Pokemon Go from time to time as I travelled into the ruins of the larger cities. The Pokestops were often restaurants, so they would help me find some food to eat. As I set up camp for a night, I plugged my mobile phone into its solar battery pack and opened up the application. \n\nSomething was off, one of the pokestops was different, outlined by a pink border and spouting flower petals. There was a *lure. * I grabbed my bags and ran towards the stop, knowing I only had a short while before the lure would disappear. It took me a good twenty minutes to come within range of the stop. \n\nI tapped on the icon to see who could possibly have placed this lure, elated at the prospect of seeing another person for the first time in ages.",
        "*Night Terror* John, initially agitated by a loud thumping sound waking him up, rubbed his eyes as he turned around and scanned the floor for his friend Luke. Highlighted by the moonlight was the empty pizza carton left between his bed and the air mattress Luke was sleeping on. His sleep-drunken gaze remained on it for a few seconds.... Until he heard Luke faintly whisper \"Help me...\" The wavering in his voice, trembling even, immediately alarmed John, who sat up in his bed. Tears reflected the moonlight off of Luke's cheeks. \"Luke? You okay, man?\" John naturally assumed that Luke was having a nightmare. He often said that he dreamt weird and scary shit after their \"binge gaming nights\". \"John? He-....... Help me. ``, he sniveled. As John peeled his eyes to make out what was going on, he was able to smell urin. \"Jesus, Luke, the fu-!? ``, John exclaimed, so very disgusted, but was interrupted by the faintest sound of a growl, made from *above* Jake. John's arm shot towards the lamp and boy, he wished he hadn't turned it on. The room lit up, revealing what looked like a misshapen child sitting bent over on Luke's chest.",
        "\"A *pumpkin*!? You turned her into a PUMPKIN!?\" I swerved, narrowly missing an oncoming car. \n\n\"Oh ya, no biggie.\" Mort's voice from the other side of the line was nonchalant, even bored. \"You know how I am with my plant magic. Got a real green thumb, ye? Besides, she was being a bit of a nag, and pumpkins don't have mouths.... amiright?\" \n\nIt was all I could do to not hang up on him right then and there. \"Mort.... I told you, use magic one more time in my house, and I would have your head.\" \n\n\"Yeh, yeh, no need to be such a buzzkill, mate.\" He said dismissively. \"But, mate. Did you even hear the rest of what I said?\" \n\nI grit my teeth. \"No, Mort. I am not going to pick you up a fifth. Hell, I am not going to pick *anything* from the store for you, *until you set her right*!\" \n\n\"Alright, alright, geeze.\" Mort sounded exasperated. \"I'll get her back to normal in a jif. Don't get your panties in a wad. Gon na need that fifth though,'s an integral part of the spell.\" \n\n\"Uh huh. And I'm the queen of England.\" My grip on my phone was so tight it was painful. \n\n\"Well, hey, if you don't *want* me to change her back.... Halloween is coming up pretty soon, mate.\" He laughed like a hyena right into the receiver, forcing me to hold my phone away from my head. \"Naw, just playing mate. I'll set her straight. But don't forget the fifth!\" \n\nHe hung up the line, leaving me to stew in my own thoughts. \"Alright.",

        "Everyone has scars, there's no denying it and if someone does they're just going to get another scar. The scars we get from telling lies don't hurt us physically, hell, we can hardly even feel them. Some scars are deep, some are hardly noticeable, but they are still there and there's no such thing as a scarless body. The only person that I have met who came close only had one scar, but it was the worst scar I have ever seen. His name is Harold and when I met him all I could see of his scar was the part that went over his eye and down his face and neck into his shirt. It wasn't until we got to know each other better that he showed me it's true extent. A scar that continued down past his heart and wrapped all the way to his back. \n\nI met Harold at a bar a few years after I graduated college, we talked over drinks and found we had a lot in common. Harold was ten years older than me, but we both had a son that was in grade school, they even went to the same school. We met more frequently at the bar and eventually started to spend time together outside of the bar. As the time passed our friendship grew stronger, we did so much together with our children that most people thought that we were related. Our children became best friends as they grew up. We were both single fathers. I had my son with a girlfriend from college who dropped him off with me one day and never came back. Harold's wife left him when his son was only a few years old. \n\nI've never been one to hide my scars. I talk about most of my scars when the topic comes up, but there are some that only Harold knows the reasoning behind. Harold never talked about his scar and that was fine, I knew when the time was right he would. I never asked because it isn't polite to ask someone about their scars. I tied to not talk about scars around Harold because I knew it made him uncomfortable considering the size of his. The only thing that I know about Harold's scar is that he didn't get it all that long ago. \n\nI asked Harold how he could go his whole life only telling one lie and he would always say he didn't ever feel the need to lie. Even if we didn't get scars with every lie, I don't think that Harold would be able to lie.",

        "I know something is different. It's not just the change in smells, or the looks on their faces, it's me too. I'm so tired, like I have been for a long time. They never seemed to mind, they'd pet me and tell me I'm a good dog - and everything was okay. \n\nEverything is okay. \n\nIt's not so bad when I realize what's different. I don't remember to well how I got her but I know this one human in his strange white thing is the needle man - but he's always been nice, too. I've been seeing him a lot lately. \n\n.... \n\nSlipped into sleep again for a few minutes there. \n\nNow everyone is here. All of the humans, all of my friends. I'm so glad to see them all, because soon I'm going to have to go to sleep for a long, long time and if I don't see them how will they know I love them? \n\nIt's so hard, but I wag my tail. I try not to look to tired. I even try to stand up, but I don't do so well and the needle man moves in and rests a hand on my side. He makes comforting noises, I guess to tell me to not try to stand, and that's okay. \n\nOne by one my humans come to me. They pet me. They give me things, little treats and big hugs. All of them smell familiar and all of them smile in a new way that is sad but still full of love. I lick them, let them know I love them so much. My tail keeps wagging, but it's slow. It's not so bad. \n\nI don't let them see how much I'm hurting, though. I've done my best not to show them that. They're my friends, I shouldn't make them sad or worried. \n\nThere's a human who is like my mother. She's taken care of me since I was a puppy. She fed me with a strange plastic thing full of milk and held me when the sky was angry and exploding and when other humans made light and booms in the sky. It's been so long. \n\nI try to lick at her face and tell her I'm sorry that I'm so tired. I don't want to go and leave her alone. I love her a little more than all the others, so much that the hurting seems little in comparison to the thought of leaving her. \n\nBut she's not mad at me. She hugs me and cries and tells me soft things that I think mean that it's okay, and I've earned my sleep. I was a good dog. I know those words. She's telling me I was a good dog, I am a good dog. I wish I could make their sounds but I don't know how. When I lick her face again, it's to say thank you. \n\nThe needleman comes and my human holds me gently, whispers softly.",
        "\"It's tough business being the only good merchant between the free cities, and the mountains to the East. Adventurers come in either going to go dungeoneering, pioneering, or just plain exploring and are always requesting top-notch gear that can't really be supplied that often. Mostly because caravans rarely come out this far so most of my stock comes from returning adventurers. There was one time that this guy sells me an amazing, never dulling, MAGIC SWORD just mumbling something about'low dps, weak cleave dmg...' but I had to buy the damn thing because I knew it could turn a profit and...\" I babbled on. \n\n\"Dude, I just need some harness rope, some spare arrows, and a better bomb bag.

She cooed over me saying I was her'hero' but I knew she didn't mean it. I saw the way she swooned over every'Conan' or'Hercules' that wandered into my shop. Maybe I was just bitter. Maybe I had a right to be mad. Maybe I should stop talking to myself. \n\n-- -- - \n\nThe week trudged on until one day, a messenger bearing a royal decree appeared with a new doctrine. It read, \"Due to the swell in adventuring tourists, and potential market boom this could bring as valuables are brought from ruins: All shopkeepers MUST purchase anything made of precious metal that is determined to come from the mountains.\" \n\n\"This is horrible,\" I said to the messenger, \"there is no way I want to buy thirty pots, pans, plates, and a couple rusty swords from some copy and paste, silent adventurer just because he shares'dragon blood' or something. I am already abused enough as a shop keep, why do I have to purchase all of these artifacts and ruins that I could never possibly sell! Plus, half of my valuable merchandise gets stolen by sneaktheives and sweet role stealers. So No! I refuse! I will travel to the king's castle, bang down his door, and demand that this law be removed.

        "Being reborn as a tree was frustrating. Being reborn in her backyard made it worse. \n\nCommitting suicide wasn't an easy decision, but I couldn't bear living without her. Knowing I'd never be with her again removed the element of fantasy and hope from my life. When I saw she'd cheated, when she told me she didn't love me anymore, ever, I felt my heart sink. The floor I'd been standing on for years collapsed beneath me. Committing suicide wasn't a decision at all, it was the only available option. \n\nI don't know how long it took, but here I am. Could have been five years, may have been twenty. It took me a while to sense that I was alive, even longer to sense the people around me. But when she pulled my first apple off and laughed of excitement, I could feel the vibrations. She woke me up. \n\nShe's moved on. I can't tell who he is, but I can feel children, I can feel happiness, I can feel warmth. I wonder if she misses me but there are no signs that she does. I ache for the days she comes to pick apples. I've been training to drop leaves and fruit on my own accord, waiting for the day she'll just venture to sit under my shade with a book. Somehow hoping that she'll understand the sign. But she never does; the modern life surrounds her, no time for sitting under trees. \n\nI've come to terms with my fate. I want it all to end again.",

She would have to paint her future. She saw Peter, her childhood friend, and then Eric, her companion during the struggle. \n\n\"Please.... Emilia...\" Peter stared at her with eyes the color of the ocean. \n\nThe heroine tugged at her braided hair and screamed. \"YOU ARE LITERALLY FORCING ME INTO A POSITION WHERE ROMANCE IS THE ISSUE WHEN MY FAMILY IS PROBABLY BEING CRUSHED UNDER OUR HOUSE. BYE.\" \n\nSo both love interests fell to the ground and Emilia rushed to save her relatives.",
        "\"Are you buying that or what?\" my wife said with a strange, emotionless face as she looked straight ahead. \n\nWe both stood there with the front door pulled open as far as the chain let it go.

        "I actually didn't see it at first. We always had some wear marks on out skin: laugh lines, crows feet, imperfections that told stories of our happiness. \n\nOne day I noticed a slight sag to her skin. Not that I cared of course, she was my love and it didn't matter what she looked like to me. But I was worried. \n\nA month after that I came home to find her collapsed on our bathroom floor sobbing, he hands full of grey hair. She had been trying to hide it from me for the last year so I wouldn't worry about her. \n\nI held her as close as I could that night. \n\nThree months later she was in a hospital. We both knew it wouldn't do any good, but it felt good to pretend. She had aged so much in a year and a half that I'm sure I looked like a favored grandchild comforting the family matriarch in her passing days, and we didn't correct anyone in order to protect our secret. \n\nShe was dying. It mad no sense to pretend otherwise, at least to myself. For her I never let on that I might be worried about her end. I tried to tell myself that it was bound to happen eventually. We've both seen friends innumerable grow and pass before us. When you're immortal, death is as familiar to you as breathing. \n\nThis kind of death was something I haven't known for a very long time. \n\nI would be alone. \n\nI would be the last immortal to walk this earth. \n\nI chose to reject the thought when it would creep back into my waking world; but in my dreams I was always alone calling out into the darkness for her.",

        "I'd been given the papers, all the documents; everything seemed in order. I'd never met the client myself\u2014my assistant typically does all of that work. I simply hear what they want from my assistant, and from what they, the client, has written on the paper. \n\nWhat? TV isn't going to watch itself. \n\nSpeaking of which, earlier that week, I was watching TV while my assistant handled some legal paperwork for some lawsuit or some something or other\u2014but that's not the point. I was watching the local news to discover which bakeries were having better sales when, when a news alert popped up. * \u201c Ski-masked criminal robs bank, $ 1 million stolen \u201d * it read, followed by a security camera feed that showed a man dressed in all black, wearing a ski mask, darting through the bank's lobby and out to a getaway car across the street. \n\nNeedless to say, I was shocked. A robbery, in our town? That's insane, seeing as we have one of the best police forces in these parts. But I digress. \n\nBack to the present: I was preparing all of my tools for the upcoming surgery, when I finally met the client for a last minute sit-down to make sure everything went well. I absolutely can not describe my shock. There, before me, in my own surgery room no less, stood that ski-masked criminal, clad in nondescript black clothing and a black ski mask. I was so stunned I nearly dropped my coffee. \n\nWhat? Coffee isn't going to drink itself. \n\nAnyway, I was nearly speechless. But when he showed me a hefty wad of cash, well, I couldn't resist. I believe the first words out of my mouth were, \u201c Well, alright then. Your nose isn't going to grow itself. \u201d \n\nAnd so we did. I had him lay down on my table, my assistant by my side, and we began to get to work. It was a little tough, I recall, working with a ski mask. The lips in particular were hard to get right thanks to the small hole\u2014cotton is a real pain to stitch a nose onto too, I might add\u2014but I got it done in one fell swoop, and it looked pretty good too. Kind of like someone took a sock puppet and pasted human facial pieces onto it. \n\nBut professionally. Because I am a professional. \n\nThe rest is history. A job well done, a face remade. \n\nSo, now to the real issue. These handcuffs aren't going to remove themselves.",

        "'What is this feeling?', I asked myself. \nI had been feeling this since the morning, this feeling of terror, a feeling which turned out to be a premonition. \nI suddenly felt that I was falling down, but caught myself in mid-air. \nMike chuckled and told me to tie my shoelaces. \nI returned to reality and saw that my shoes had indeed come untied. \n\nI did just what he said. As I bent down, that feeling returned. I decided to shrug it off. As I did, Mike continued walking. I looked up and saw two things at once. One, he had created a five foot gap between us, and two, a man coming out from a side alley, grabbing a silenced pistol from his jacket, grabbing Mike and pulling him into said alley, and shooting him. \n\nAt that moment, I froze. I was still bent, only my face was up and I had just become witness to the assassination of one my co-workers and friends. I didn't know how to react, but I knew had to stay calm because I had just been walking with Mike. I was quite certain that if I stepped any further, the man would see me. I again bowed my head and pretended to tie my shoe. Okay, Mike is dead. You just saw it, and you can't do much about it. Two shots to the chest would probably kill anyone, and by the way the assassin had grabbed Mike, it was quite possible that Mike was in that dumpster that I knew was in that alley. \n\n'I thought you said there would be two.', I heard the man say. \nA tremor went down my spine when I heard the next sentence,'Tying his shoelaces?' \nOh, crap.",
        "I sat waiting at the bus stop as I did every day and sitting across the street same as all the other days, he sat. An older man, bearded and wearing the same dirty layers he wore the first time I'd seen him nearly a month ago. \n\nMost days I'd roll my eyes at the sight of him, rattling that cup of money around, begging. *Why don't you just get a job? * I'd think at him. *There are shelters if you're desperate, you're just not willing to try. * \n\nOccasionally I would wonder what his story was, wonder if I was judging him too quickly but before I could give it much thought, my bus would arrive and I'd be on my way to classes for the day. \n\nToday, something happened. \n\nA group of guys walk over to him and start taunting him, calling him names. I can see my bus coming a few streets away, and am glad that I'll be out of here soon. I try to avoid looking in the direction of the action, but inevitably I end up looking back to watch. Humans are so weird the way we can't seem to look away from a train wreck situation. \n\nJust as my bus is pulling up to the stop in front of me, I watch the thugs snatch away the cup of change from the homeless man's hand and kick him square in the face. I jump, hand flying to my mouth as the bus blocks my view. Without thinking, I jump to my feet and run right around the bus and, carefully checking for oncoming traffic, cross the street. \n\nLaying on his side is the man, holding his bleeding face while the men hurry away from him, laughing. I take out a handkerchief from my pocket and offer it to him. Graciously he takes it from my hands, dabbing at his nose and behind us the bus drives off. If I make it to class today, I'll be very late. \n\nAs my attention gives itself fully to the man, I hear myself saying \"I'm so sorry.\" Thought I'm not really sure why I'm apologizing. He doesn't respond, a look of defeat in his eyes. \"Can I take you to get something to eat?\" I offer. He doesn't give me much of an answer, but I decide that if he doesn't refuse I'll take him. I help pull him to his feet and walk at a slow pace with him to the mcdonalds a few blocks ahead. \n\nI sit down with him in a booth for a moment, he's still wearing that same look of defeat. I want to encourage him somehow but I find myself at a loss for words. I've never been in his shoes, in fact I don't even know *what* his story really is. Before I can even think it over, those are the next words finding their way out of my mouth. \n\n\"What's your story?\" He looks up at me and as our eyes meet I can see a life behind his. A long and hard life.",
        "The man in the hoodie could barely stop snickering. I couldn't see his face, but that was normal for most clients meeting in the flesh. We were sitting at the diner at Fourth and Union, just like he requested. \n\nWith gloved hands, he slid a small envelope forward. \n\n\"The mark?\" \n\nHe nodded, still holding back laughs. He was doing that pulsating jigger people do when they're laughing hard but not breathing, or when they want to laugh really hard but refuse to allow themselves the air to do it. Whatever. The money was most important. \n\nI opened the envelope and saw a picture of myself. I looked up at the man. \n\n\"Is this a fucking joke?\" \n\nThe man took off his hoodie and what was underneath was too horrifying to describe. \n\n***\" SURPRISE MOTHERFUCKER!! \"*** \n\nI died instantly.

Stop a rape, or a murder. Fall back into my regular life. Seemed like a dream. Until I found out what exactly happened to me while I stopped time. I aged along with it. It wasn't noticeable to me for the first few years, as I never stopped time for too long. Scared something would happen. But when I turned 40, my doctor pulled me aside.

        "Before I start this story, I would just like to say I don't mean any cats any harm. I really don't - I mean, come on, I'm practically one of them. Some people even call me catty. Even if I don't quite get catcalls. \n\nYes, I *am* a guy. \n\nMy name is Jaymes - yes, my parents chose to spell it with a \"y\", because well, \"y\" not? Eh, eh? No? \n\nOkay, anyway. This story begins on an ordinary Tuesday night, just like this one. All week, I had been noticing the stray cats snooping around, moving quite a bit both in the day and at night. Something was brewing - I just assumed it was some sort of cat-turf war or a great Wild Cat Hunt for some rats. So, I decided to follow one particular cat I had fed once or twice. \n\nThe cat had fur that was a brownish hue, like the sort you'd find on wood or chocolate. The sort that seemed just too beautiful for nature to produce. Though that might have just been the dirt. I stalked - or, well, tried to stalk - closely behind it, ducking left and right behind walls like I had seen people do in all the shows and games. And every time I did this, I thought to myself with an imaginary fist pump, \"Juked!\" \n\nIt probably noticed me but continued onward anyway. Slowly, towards an abandoned parking lot, which was barely used even in its heyday, but now laid in a state of discard and disrepair. A few trees had somehow taken root in the worn out cracks of the old cement and concrete surface, brute forcing their way out of the black asphalt in a startlingly violent manner.",
        "\"Good Morning, Diane.\" The voice was friendly, never annoyed. It came from the ceiling and said those words every morning at six-thirty. \n\n\"Good Morning, DAD.\" Diane stretched in bed, yawned and rubbed her eyes. She flipped the covers off and sat up, scratching her scalp. \n\n\"Are you ready for your big day?\" DAD (Digital Adult Diagnostics) asked with the same voice. Always the same voice. Diane had not known about inflection until she was seven and was finally shown video from the outside world. Until then, she had also talked with a flat, even voice. Not so much now. She had learned to color her intonation to fit the moment. Thank you \"Small Wonder\" reruns. \n\n\"Sure. Big day. I'll be ready in a few. I've just got to get cleaned up. Give me a minute, please.\" \n\n\"Of course, Diane. Come out to the dining area when you are ready.\" \n\n\"I'll be there in a few.\" Diane entered the bathroom and did the usual: brushed her teeth, emptied her bladder. She knew that she was not really alone. DAD was watching. Analyzing. If the chemistry of her urine was off, DAD would know. If she did not brush for at least two minutes, DAD would know. Diane had long ago learned that she must do these things or there would be consequences. DAD insisted that these things were needed to keep Diane healthy; that DAD was not hectoring Diane without reason. So be it. Diane had also learned to pick her battles with the computer. \n\nAfter getting dressed, Diane went down to the dining room and had breakfast. Today was a good day: he got scrambled eggs and bacon with his orange juice. Diane knew that it was all laced with vitamins and minerals and other assorted chemicals to help keep her healthy. She ate it anyway. \n\nDiane did her calisthenics after breakfast. She had had a debate with DAD once about doing exercise on a full stomach. The computer claimed that the data was inconclusive as to whether or not there were any issues. She claimed that it made her feel queasy. They had tried doing her exercises before breakfast for a month. Afterward, DAD had shown her graphs and data about her heart rate, blood sugar levels, blood oxygen and other metrics. It showed little difference. Diane admitted that she was too hungry to exercise first anyway. DAD said that it would monitor her and ensure that everything was optimal. \n\nAnd then, it was time. \"Okay, DAD, what do I do?\" \n\n\"Go to the door and wait. It will just be a minute.\" Diane approached the door. The Door. The one portal that she had never opened. DAD claimed that it led to the Outside. For the past sixteen years, Diane had been inside these walls: a bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchen and dining area, an exercise room and an office. And DAD. Today she turned sixteen. Today she was allowed to see Outside. \n\nThe door itself was no different from all of the others in the apartment: glossy white with a chrome lever handle. It matched the walls and ceiling. She had tried the handle a few times and knew it would not move. DAD had told her as much, but she had needed to try it herself. Finally, when she was nine, Diane had run up to it, jumped and put all of her weight on it. The handle had bent a small amount, but the door had remained firmly locked. The next day, the handle had been repaired. She had not touched it since. \n\nNow, waiting at the door, Diane felt her heart speed up, more than it had on the treadmill. What would it be like, she thought. She had seen pictures and videos and heard recordings, but that had not been the same. Even in the office with its full immersion projection walls, there had still been something missing. Or rather, as she thought about it more, something extra present: DAD. DAD would never let anything bad happen to her. There was no risk to anything she ever did. Today, she would be leaving DAD, if only for a few hours. That was exhilarating. \n\nA minute passed and nothing happened. The door did not open, no one knocked. None of the things that she had anticipated. Finally, she asked. \"DAD, is it time? What is going on?\" \n\n\"I'm sorry, Diane. There has been a small problem. I'm hoping to have it resolved in a minute.\" \n\n\"What sort of problem?\" \n\n\"Please do not be concerned. It will all be fixed soon.\" Diane waited for another five minutes, standing in front of the door, staring at the handle. She had learned patience and focus under DAD's watchful eye. But even then there are limits.",

        "I feel like I'm in a museum, looking at the strange, old echoes of a world I can't seem to fully understand. Feelings of old people, sadness that's creeped up in paint, veneer, wrinkled skin. Such stillness. Minds you just can't reach, that are always behind the horizon. I thought I would feel repulsed but I don't, my beliefs in the world are only slightly hampered, and only temporarily. Somewhere on the edge of my mind is the tendency to blame it on capitalism. As if socialism were any better. It feels too easy. It feels like I've been set up to make that connection. The endless documentaries and talking heads. Socialism is no better, and the truth of the matter is that we really don't have an answer. I have this triggered sense of superiority which I loath. Mostly because it's that: it's triggered. I don't have the answers, nobody does. Yet deep down I still feel I would never be so crazy as to take my own life. What were these people thinking when they did it? Did this forest somehow remind them of a museum? Did they want to make a statement? I was always thought committing suicide is an act of aggression. Did these people have a raging fire in their hearts, as they kneeled on the ground, quietly preparing their ropes, quietly setting up their tents? But the world played one last trick on them. It wiped out any sense of rage, of victory, even desperation. I only feel slightly less confident about the world I find myself in. A subtle sabotaging, an eerie, distant discomfort.",

        "'Commander David Strauss. That's my name and that's my Job.' Strauss thinks to himself. Playing with his new title in his head. \n\nSystems engineer for Germanys Air Force, he helped rewrite and rework the entire decaying infrastructure from scratch. Rebuilding a building as it slowly fell apart was the way he liked to describe what he did to anyone who asked. That was only 2 years ago. With that under his belt he was an obvious candidate for this Mission. \n\n6 months ago. A new high resolution telescope lens was being tested in orbit around the moon. The Pictures it obtained were being studied when an Intern working in the mail room, while on his rounds, came across the pictures and pointed out what he thought to be a smudge on the lens. A smudge on a million dollar lens the space agency worked so hard to get into space. No way that was possible. After much review and study, it was discovered that the'smudge' was in fact an opening in a crater wall on the dark side of the moon. The news was covered up quickly enough. Those working on it were paid off, the pictures edited and released to the public. China, The European Union and Russia were all called in for a meeting in Iceland. NASA led the inquiry. After plenty of finger pointing, baseless accusations, spits and several fist fights with and at one another it was concluded that this structure was not ours. At best it was a geological abnormality, at worst, a possible military structure some other nation had secretly built. 6 months later and here he was, landing on the surface on the Moon. The Russians provided the necessary distractions and Satellite Coverage for the Mission to be carried out without anyone noticing. China gave their best Rocket for the Mission, sparing no expense on equipment, re doing the entire internal system for other nations usage. NASA gave their best engineer and science officer: Jackie Hornwell, now seated opposite him in the small lander. The European Union took care of all Media and news coverage as best they could, they also coughed up their best systems engineer and military communications expert; David Strauss, and Phillip rou\u00e9 from Paris, now situated in their command vessels communication hub in stationary orbit above the crater in question. \n\nPhillip: How's it going guys? Puke bags are under your seats if you need them. Your about 30 seconds from landing. \nJackie: Fuck off Phillip \nDavid: Phillip lets maintain Radio Silence till Dr Jackie can get her bearings in order over? \nPhillip: Got it, over and out. \n\nTheir landing was as soft as it could have been expected. David moved the control pad from the side wall out in front of him and began typing in commands, checking if the systems were all still good to go. \n\nDavid: Ship looks good.

        "\"Another day in hell, right James?\" I said to my coworker as we sat poolside. \n\n\"Right. This is the last time we come to Hawaii for a client, I can't stand this torture.\" \n\nWe shared a laugh, then continued reading our books in silence. I was three hundred pages deep into a romance novel that I bought for five dollars under James' recommendation at the Wal-Mart across the street. He was reading \"The anatomy and psychology of the penguin\". He was oddly obsessed with this book, but whatever man, different strokes. \n\nI turned the page, revealing the first page of part three. The page was blank other than the bold font in the center reading \"a lovers quarrel\". I stopped reading and fell into a deep metaphorical pit of reflectance on the night I had spent fighting with my wife before I left on this damn trip. I glanced at the ring on my left ring finger, and a smile swept over my face as I basked in the feeling of her heartbeat pulsating through my ring. These rings were the first in the industry that had the touch feature, totally worth the twenty thousand dollars each in moments like these. \n\nI snapped out of it and turned the page to the content in part three. The first ten pages described a horrific case of domestic violence between two characters, a husband and wife. The man, unable to handle the marriage any longer due to his wife's severe PTSD, decided that he would kill his wife in her sleep. He succeeded, with a significant struggle on the wife's part, leaving the husband with a broken wrist and stab wound above his right hip. What a disgusting man that husband is, no wife should be harmed by her husband. \n\n\"James, why did you suggest this book, you know I love my wife.\" \n\nJames responded with silence, the slowly looked at me with a beat red face and bloodshot eyes. He screamed at the top of his lungs \"STOP IT, YOU'RE HURTING ME.\" \nKnowing James, he was playing a joke on me. \n\n\"Real funny James, cut it out.\" \n\nUpon standing from my pool chair, I awoke standing in my kitchen. There was a knife in my abdomen and my arm broken at the wrist. The ring in my finger was pulsating harder than it ever has before, then it suddenly stopped. \n\n\"Not her, please lord not her.\" I thought as I ran into our bedroom. There she was, laying on our bed. Her eyes were open and lifeless, and there was blood leaking out of a large slice in her throat. I ran back to the kitchen, pulled the knife out of my side with my healthy arm, and proceeded to sew the hole shut. That whole trip was a dream. As I thought that to myself the reality sunk in. \n\nI just killed my wife. I murdered her in my sleep. I'm going to prison if I survive. I'll get raped in prison. \n\nI laid the body of my once gorgeous wife in the trunk of my Honda Prius, grabbed my shovel, and began driving to the hills. I found a spot where I was going to bury her. \nAs I began to dig my wife's grave, my Katy Perry ringtone began to play in my pocket. I frantically answered it, blurting the first words I thought of \"I'm innocent I didn't do it!\" \n\n\"Sir, we received a notification of an irregular heartbeat on your wife's touch band, is she alright?\"",
        "No one can quite remember when the Last War started. Our best guess was a few years after the Great Doom, when the outside world was destroyed and our store became the only remaining sanctuary left. In response to a milk shortage, Dairy raised their prices astronomically, prompting Pharmacy to do the same. That was the final straw. Butter and milk is one thing, but when no one can afford antibiotics, it's just a matter of time until everything exploded. \n\nSporting Goods and Automotive aligned together and struck the first blow. They had grown very militaristic since the Doom, as they had the only access to dangerous weapons and equipment at the time. They invaded Pharmacy and annexed them. There isn't much a pill bottle or thermometer can do against the Tire Knights once they were armed with rifles and hunting knives. They struck a deal with Grocery, food in exchange for medicine, and the three factions quickly established themselves as the dominant alliance. \n\nBut it didn't last. It never did. The legend goes that black-hat operatives from Electronics staged a false flag operation to make it look like Automotive had been stealing guns and crossbows, using those weapons to trade Fashion for free-flowing clothes, then selling the clothing back to Sporting Goods. That became the bloodiest civil war in our history, even more violent than the Familial War, when Men's, Women's, and Kid's splintered. \n\nAll this was so many years ago. So much time has passed that few can even remember why we fight, or what the Outside is like. Division and mistrust is so embedded here, there is great doubt if the store could ever run again, all the sections in harmony, operating the massive commercial outpost it was before. But war has never bothered me, or my fathers, or their fathers before them. For a hundred generations we have existed alongside war, but war has never affected us. Our section remains the lone island in this turbulent sea of conflict. \n\nWhy is that, you ask? It's simple. Our tribe is the Keeper of the Gardening section, the Watcher of the Harvest.",
        "\u201c The crowd outside has reached bedlam. And by that I mean\u2026 it hasn't. \u201d \n\n\nPolice Chief Petunia was stumped. He cradled his soy milk half-caf delicately in his manicured fingers. \n\n\n\u201c When I first joined the force these kids meant business. They were up in arms, sticking rose petals in carbines or sitting at the counter of Woolworth's\u2026. sinisterly\u2026. just waiting for a nightstick to the midsection or a fire hose blast to the sternum. Bring me the new recruit. \u201d \n\n\nPolice Chief Petunia took a sip from his drink, furrowed his brow, and then tore the lid off of a sugar dispenser filled with low calorie artificial sweetener labeled \u201c organic. \u201d He poured the majority of the contents into his drink. It immediately crystallized into some form of viscous sludge. A meek young man, just a few days removed from his 18th birthday, ambled towards him. \n\n\n\u201c H\u2026 hello Chief. I don't know why Officer Stacy thought my hands were down my uniform but I can assure you\u2026 \u201d \n\n\n\u201c Enough. We have a job for you, Cadet Deefus. I've been Chief of Police here in Stagsack for 28 years, and never have I seen a protest like this. These kids are so\u2026 placid. So calm. They must be stopped. \u201d \n\n\nCadet Deefus stood there, small-armed and soft-bellied, his slack jaw hanging in direct parallel to his delicate unibrow. \n\n\n\u201c S\u2026 stopped, sir? \u201d \n\n\nPolice Chief Petunia strolled over to a locker with a menacing looking exterior lock. He gently tugged at it and it snapped open. He reached inside the locker and pulled out various articles of clothing. \n\n\n\u201c Here is your riot gear, cadet. You're going out to the front lines. We can't assure your safety\u2026 but we can assure you that a reasonably priced plaque will be hung in your honor. Haven't you always wanted to be a hero, son? \u201d \n\n\nCadet Deefus stuck out his gaunt arms, collecting the riot gear from Police Chief Petunia. A pair of lensless horn-rimmed glasses. A green cardigan. A tight pair of khakis. And most importantly, wingtips. \n\n\n\u201c Put these on. Report to the front lines. When I give you the signal, you charge. \u201d \n\n\n\u201c Ch\u2026 charge the protestors, sir? But they're just sitting there\u2026 \u201d \n\n\n\u201c If I wanted you to charge them I would have said so! No. I will be out there with Officer Stacy and the better half of our K-9 unit. I want you to charge towards us! \u201d \n\n\n\u201c S... sir? \u201d \n\n\n\u201c You heard me cadet! Now get moving. \u201d \n\n\nA rotund lump formed in Cadet Deefus's meager throat. He shrugged his shoulders, removed his uniform and placed the riot gear over his meager frame. The door lightly shook on its hinges as he attempted to slam it on his way out. \n\n\nOutside of the police building the crowd had grown complacent. The rally cries of \u201c Mock our sins no more! \u201d ceased to ring out through the idyllic Vermont rolling hillsides. Nobody knew what exactly had precipitated the beginning of this pro-Wingtip protest, and nobody seemed to wonder why. A thin figure gawked at the crowd from inside the door, before being pushed out by a sturdy hand with well-polished fingernails. \n\n\n\u201c Uh\u2026 uh\u2026. Up with Wingtips! \u201d \n\n\nA quiet rally cry returned the sentiment. \n\n\n\u201c No more moccasins! \u201d \n\n\nA second rally cry, quieter than the first, re-affirmed the notion. \n\n\nCadet Deefus cast a furtive glance towards the headquarters, as a squadron of heavily armed officers and hungry German Shepherds advanced towards the reclining protestors. Police Chief Petunia raised his riot shield in the air three times; the unmistakable international symbol for \u201c charge at me. \u201d Cadet Deefus removed a wingtip and tossed it towards the officers, the loafer covering half the distance between his limp wrist and the intimidating legion of officers. The sinewy legs of Cadet Deefus ran towards the battalion. \n\n\n\u201c Fire up the tear gas, boys. \u201d \n\n\nNo fewer than three canisters of Civil Rights grade tear gas sprang out from the officers, landing upon the unsuspecting protestors like artillery fire. One round hit a small dog, who bit the crotch of the closest individual. The pro-Wingtip crowd began coughing, sneezing, choking, vomiting, oozing and crying. A thick fog formed over the crowd and visibility fell to zero. \n\n\n\u201c You know what to do! \u201d \n\n\nCadet Deefus had no idea what to do. His eyes burned, his throat was dry, a burning rash was forming on his skin and his dry heaves were causing him severe discomfort. The police pounced upon him, their batons ready. \n\n\n\u201c Here's one right here! 200 points! \u201d \n\n\nFortunately for Cadet Deefus he did not suffer long, as he quickly lost consciousness upon reaching his pain threshold. He woke up several days later, in a plastic bed, a bronze plaque dangling from Police Chief Petunia's supple hands.",
        "Colin and Felicity were the proudest of parents. Little Rupert had been born in perfect health. They had held each other and beamed as Rupert was transferred by the doctor into the genetic coding chamber. \n\n\"Are you ready to program your son?\" Asked the doctor with a smile. \n\nColin and Felicity looked at each other nodding. \"Yes,\" said Felicity, grasping Colin's hand. \"Yes we are.\" \n\nRupert was placed in the gene manipulation chamber. The machine had put an end to genetic disease overnight, as it allowed the traits of newborns to be selected by the parents. However, while dangerous genomes would automatically be modified,'luxury alterations' (as they were known) were effected by means of chance. \n\nExcessive populational perfection was deemed dangerous and undesirable by various governing bodies. So, parents would roll dice to determine how their child would develop. \n\n\"OK,\" said the doctor. The contraption looked like a vending machine, and he motioned to a hole that looked like something for dispensing change. \"Collect the dice from here,\" he said, \"and drop them in the hole up here. The machine will reveal the number of the roll, and that score will then represent the ability of your child in that particular area. Once you have the score, press next here and the dice will drop again.\" The doctor puffed out his cheeks and laughed. \"Any questions?\" \n\n\"No,\" said Colin, looking at Felicity. \"I think we've got it, thanks.\" \n\n\"Then over to you,\" he chirped. \n\nAlone in the room with his wife and child, Colin walked over to the machine, pressing his palm against the glass. Rupert looked perfect already. Felicity watched on from the bed. \n\n\"What is the first trait?\" She asked excitedly. \n\n\"Beauty,\" said Colin. He took the dice from the tray. \"Ready?\" He asked, looking back at Felicity. \n\n\"Yes, do it.\" She made a high pitched whine of excitement. \n\nColin dropped the dice into the slot, heard some clicking, followed by a small rattle, and then a gulp. A digital display behind Rupert read'6'. \n\n\"Yeah!\" Shouted Colin. \"Six out of six! Our kid is going to be a looker!\" \n\nBoth parents celebrated and wooped, they high-fived and hugged, and after a minute or two, having pressed'next', Colin was again collecting the dice. \n\nHe turned around with a look of seriousness. Fiona looked suddenly concerned. \n\n\"Is there a problem?\" She asked. \n\n\"This next one is intelligence,\" said Colin soberly. \n\nFelicity gasped. \"Make sure you roll it well,\" she warned, and put her hands together and began to pray. \n\nColin nodded, and turned back to the machine. He exhaled deeply. He dropped the dice in the hole - click, rattle, gulp - and the machine read'3'. \n\n\"What is it?\" Cried Felicity. \n\n\"Three,\" said Colin. For a moment there was silence. \n\nFelicity looked up with concentration. \"You know, three isn't too bad, Colin?\" \n\nColin pondered the score. \"No, I suppose not.\" \n\n\"After all,\" said Felicity, \"Jerry's boy rolled low for intelligence! Margaret told me so\" \n\n\"Jerry's boy?\" Said Colin incredulously. \"Well he seems perfectly bright to me...\" \n\n\"Well exactly,\" said Felicity. \"And our Rupert has a three! That's not even low! It's middle of the road!\" \n\n\"Middle of the road...\" Parroted Colin with wonder. He suddenly felt quite pleased with himself and pressed'next' with renewed optimism.",
        "*Did he not wash off this plate? No, of course not. The ketchup is dried and stuck to the damn plate, and whatever bread-covered thing he ate is seemingly glued to the porcelain as well. * \n\n*And, oh look, wonderful, great! He drank milk and didn't wash it out, love the look of sour solidified dairy in the bottom of a cup. I can't even reach the bottom. * The dull white ring looked up like an O from the bottom of the glass. *It's Hell, alright, not even providing something that can reach down tall glasses. * \n\n*And here's another mac and cheese crusted pot, not set in hot water to soak. For fuck's sake.... He's Lucifer and all, but damn dude, all you have to do is fill it with warm soapy water. Would make my life helluva easier! * \n\n*Sucha' lazy piece of shit, he is.

I'll do some plates now and have them out on the drying rack here soon.\" \n\n\"Good.\" He turned and left, leaving charred rings in the marble floor. \n\n*I'd love to ram his damn plates down his throat and watch him die slowly. And his stupid friends, other demons from dumb places that no one even know existed. In'Pher? That's not even a damn planet. Oblivion? Does anyone even go there, ever? And what about Limbo? A middle-man, just a middle-man, why even have a ruler there, really? * \n\n*Another bowl covered in dried out oatmeal! GOD DAMMIT! Fuck this place, fuck him, fuck everything! I'm done! I'm quitting! I rather be pronged and raped by a dozen demons that have to grind away at a bowl for the next hour because he couldn't just wash it out before setting it in the sink!

        "Looking in the mirror, Lee though to himself: *I'm a really evil person\". He smiled. *I might actually be the most evil there is*. The smug smirk on his face because even more pronounced. His grin widened. *I wonder if I can get even more evil*. He stayed for one more minute in front of the mirror, thinking. Then, his face suddenly lit up, as if a brilliant idea just crossed his perverted mind. He went to his computer, along the way kicking his malnourished dog in the stomach. At his desk, he typed \"demon summoning 101\". For good luck, or bad luck depending on how you put it, he went to the 66th page if the results and clicked on the 6th link. There, his found some instructions. *Let's see, I need someone human blood to draw a pentagram and I need to recite Demonicum Invocatio Abadonum three times while holding a candle*. The site said \"use your own blood\". *Bullshit! * Lee cried. He got up, went to the basement and drew some blood from the homeless person he kept chained down there. Before leaving, he proceeded to kick his prisoner, for no other reason than the pleasure he felt when he hurt others. He got a candle, drew the pentagram on the middle of the floor and proceeded to do the invocation. A few moments pass and he hears a deep voice. \n\n*This is Abbadon, demon lord of despair and destruction, who dares summon me? * \n\n*Yeah, hi, this is Lee. Cool, so it worked. Well, I'm an evil person and I want to be possessed by a demon to become even more evil* \n\nSilence for a moment. \n\n*Very well spoke Abbadon* A bright red flesh engulfed Lee for a moment. *You are now possessed by me. I shall plant evil thoughts into your mind and you shall obey me! I see you have a dog. You will not feed your dog daily from now on, it shall only receive food every other day! * \n\n*Urgh, mkay* Lee was a bit disappointed. Guessing the demon was just warming up he put a coat on and left. \n\n*Where are we going? * Asked Abbadon. *Do you have evil deeds in mind or are you in need of more suggestions? * \n\n*I'm going to the hospital to molest some babies* replied Lee. *Got something more evil to do? I've been contemplating genocide for a while but it's a bit hard to not get caught* \n\n*Wtf dude!? * Abbadon was clearly surprised. *What do you mean you go to molest babies? What sort of sick fu & k are you?! * \n\n*Yeah, I'm a doctor, I work the night shifts and have access to the maternity ward. When they discover abused babies, they always blame the janitors. Idiots! * \n\nAbbadon was not expecting this. \n\n*Here's a bank, look, just, just go in and tell them you want to be a banker.",
        "``.... And that's why this drug is suitable for those suffering from Garlic Allergy. All tests, data and samples are available to the FDA, and I hope you can pass this soon, to alleviate the sufferering of those with allergy to Allium sativum.\" I smiled at the board who listened in silence. Not once did I mention my *true* reason for my experimentation; why, they'd never believe me. No, better to hide it behind a facade of mortal suffering. \nA cough freed me from my thoughts. The senior scientist of the group had faced me with a cryptic look on his face. \n\"That's.... all very well, Mr Chiroptera, but this isn't why you made it.\" My grin froze on my face, does he susp.... \n\"The reason you made it was to free Vampires from one of their weaknesses. And that will not happen.\" I attempted to stutter an objection, \"how - how *absurd*. Vampires? I am...\" \n\"A Vampire. We know. And we've known about this garlic cure for a long time.\" A whisper of wind behind me; I turned with inhuman speed, but too late, the mailed fist grabbed me by the the neck and slammed me to the table. A laser pen, of all things, was shoved in my eye. \n\"*This little trinket gives a high intensity UV beam. It will fry your brain if you so much as twitch*\" growled my captor. A waft of his smell informed me as to his true nature. \n\"Werewolf\" I whispered. \n\"Indeed, Mr Chiroptera! Or should I say Baron Alcar. Yes, Frank here is one of the FDA's most helpful agents in these matters.\" \n\"If you were a proper scientist, you would have known we do not normally give interviews to vouch for your drug. No, we want to offer you a *job*\" \nA job? Hah!",
        "Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock. \n\nMidnight. It was officially her 30th birthday. Alone in the darkened apartment she took a sip of her whiskey. This is the year she has to make her decision. Does she live on or volunteer for eradication. Another sip from the glass. It wasn't fair dammit. She didn't want to die. Despite the crowded streets and high rise apartments, despite waiting in lines for hours for rations, despite the smog storms and the violence, despite all of it \u2026 she wanted to live. \n\nLiving came with a price, however. You were kicked out of the city for one. No more apartment, no more rations. No more whiskey, she supposed. But what did dying get you? Well \u2026 dead for, one. It was considered the noble life choice after all. She got up from her chair and crossed over to the only window in the small apartment, peering out over the city. \n\nShe wondered how many other birthdays there were today. How many people were faced with the same choice she now faced. Live or die. Another sip from the glass. The whiskey was fogging her mind, but the numbness was welcome. She and been anticipating this day for over a year now but still could not make up her mind. The government generously allowed you 30 days from midnight of your 30th birthday to decide your own fate. A great many chose death, their names forever etched in the Great Tower of Life at the center of town. Some decided to take their chances outside the wall, many of whom were never heard from again. Anyone who did not make their decision was taken away by the government. It was assumed they were killed but their names were never etched on the tower. Truth was no one really knew what happened to those who failed to make the choice. \n\nShe opened the window to her apartment. The cool night air felt good on her flushed face. * \u201d I want to live, \u201d * she thought to herself. She leaned over the edge of the window looking down the 20 stories to the ground. * \u201d I want to live, \u201d * she thought again leaning even further over the edge closing her eyes. * \u201d I want to live \u201d * she released the glass from her hand letting it fall to the ground far below.",
        "\"Are you mad?\" she said to be, eyes wide and full of fear. \n\n\"Mad? No. I'm not mad,\" I replied. \"I'm just.... I'm overwhelmed.\" \n\nI thought back to all the times we had spent playing together. The nights we had spent cuddling under the warm blanket on the upstairs couch. I could remember so many of the meals I had made for her and how much we enjoyed each other's company. I had always known that our bond was special, but now this. And this was just.... it was something else. \n\n\"It's bothering you, I can tell,\" she said to me softly. \"You've got the far-away look on your face, the one you always affect when you want to pretend like something isn't bothering you.\" \n\n\"It's not that.\" \n\n\"But it is. You can not lie to me. You need to understand that. Voxangelikus, this won't change things between us.\" \n\nThat was a laugh. How could something this big not completely and permanently alter the entire foundation of our relationship? It would be like waking up and finding out that the blue sky above you for all of these years was actually neon pink. Even though you'd eventually get used to it you'd still always think of the sky as blue, not hot pink. \n\n\"Things are already changed,\" I said. \"You know they are.\" \n\n\"No,\" she purred, trying to pull herself against me. I pulled away and could sense her disappointment. She sighed heavily. \"Yes. Things are changed. But it doesn't have to be bad, you know. We can still make things work out. It can maybe even be better than before.\" \n\nMaybe she was right. Maybe things could work out in the end. They would always be a little weird or difficult, but then again, our entire relationship had always had an element of strangeness to it, so it wasn't that far-fetched to think this might work out somehow. I put my hand on her head and rubbed behind her neck. I scratched her behind the ears and rubbed her on the butt. Her back arched up and she purred heartily and said, \"That feels so nice!\"",
        "I loved to lay in bed at night and feel the gentle rise and fall of her chest. To see the quirky way she smiled as she dreamed. Sometimes I would sit for hours trying to decipher whatever it was she was saying in her sleep, hoping there might be some message for me. I knew she loved me. She always made me feel loved. \n\nThen there were times when she would furrow her brow and look frustrated and even scared. I wondered if those were dreams of being chased. I'd lay my head against her chest and hear her heart pounding in those moments. I'd wonder what was chasing her, was it someone she knew, was it a wild animal, a dog even. The thought scared me too. \n\nBut I had her and that was all I needed for now. So night after night we'd have dinner together and she would tell me about her day. Then at the end, we'd settle into bed together and drift off to sleep. Except that she almost always fidgeted and woke me up. It was fine, though, I preferred it even. Because then I got to lay here and listen to her breath. \n\nI wish I could love her like she does me, but I just can't. Especially not after how she acted toward the presents I gave her. I'd have my revenge for that.",
        "And so he bitterly asked, \"Why?\" \n\nI answered \"Because I'm the sort of dick that submits writing that really can't even be considered a story to /r/WritingPrompts\" \n\nHe then said \"Mods!

        "\"Bloody Hell, really?\" \n\nThe imp shrugged. \"Not my problem, I use the same charts come across the smoke signals every week, same as everyone else what's sellin, same as everyone else what's buyin.\" he said in his animated little growl. \"It's the same bloody drink an- \"\n\n\"No,\" said Azazel, \"I meant, I didn't realise it was that bad.\" \n\n\"Do you want it or not?\" \n\n\"Fine,\" Azazel replied, and threw the twenty over for the pint of blood. He carried it deftly back across The Two Horns, avoiding the eyes of the gorgon who'd been haunting him for the better part of that month. He slid back down onto the bench and regarded the pint in front of him, still trying to work out whether he'd been deceived. \n\n\"Something wrong with the sauce, son?\" Mephisto nudged his elbow with the question, bringing Azazel out of his trance. \n\n\"Cost me twenty, that did.\" \n\n\"Same as mine.\" \n\n\"Yea. What I'm saying is, pints cost twenty now?\" \n\n\"You haven't been up in a while have you mate?\" \n\n\"Well, I'm not the salesman like you, Meph,\" said Azazel, allowing his annoyance to carry over into the conversation. \"I did my job and now I'm done.\" \n\n\"Expecting a better return on investment, were you?\" \n\n\"I suppose. How many of them are there now?\" \n\n\"Bout, 7? Bit more.\" \n\n\"Christ.\" \nMephisto laughed. \"I know man. Soon it'll cost less to just go up and buy a pint there.\" \n\n\"I mean, are they doing anything about it? You're the economist. I mean. I won't be able to afford coming here soon.\" \n\n\"Not much they can do,\" Mephisto said as he combined a sip and a shrug, \"Pandae keeps moanin on about whatever they can, but they and everyone else have been realising how long they've been caught twiddling their tails. Basically, right at the same time the population began to explode, which was coz of the industrial revolution, basically, Heaven put in these new policies that are just now starting to pay off.\" The salesman inside him was getting excited now, which was the cause of the rambling. Loved to have something complicated to explain, especially when it involved spiritual currency. \"They've been long-conning us, for sure. We thought we'd had the whole thing wrapped up what with the whole human race being born into damnation. But with predestination, that made everyone work as hard as they could to convince themselves they were predestined. And Heaven was able to skim off the top and send the rest to us, and we thought, sounds like a pretty good deal. Now we're realising that quantity is not better than quality. What they've managed to do is send Hell's entire economy downwards, pardon the expression.",
        "It wasn't a long trip to the bottom, but it wasn't a short one either. If he'd had to guess, Callum would have said it was somewhere between the time it takes to say * \u201c God bless you \u201d * and the time it takes for a candle to snuff out with a final soft *whoof*. \n\nIt was the summer of 1973. Elton John had just released his album \u201c *Goodbye Yellow Brick Road* \u201d - his seventh and most popular yet - and the troops had returned home from Vietnam. (\u201c *God bless us, Halleluiah! * \u201d Callum's mother had said to the gaggle of family members gathered around the television at the time, planting a kiss on a reluctant Callum's head.) In many ways it was an End Summer. It carried with it a sense of things coming to a close, of things changing, and as the hour-hand wound its way to Fall on the great grandfather clock in the hall a part of Callum *did* end; there, behind the A plus One convenience store. Though he wouldn't know it at the time, his childhood had slipped away that summer - like sand through the crack in an hourglass - and only much later would he realise; some things you just can not mend. \n\nIt was such a logical conclusion to reach, but since when had men in their youth ever been logical? The group met on the edge of the great-wide parking lot behind the A plus One convenience store - owned by a St. Peters catholic who both smoked and smiled heartily (and was known for pushing a pack of cigarettes over the counter when handed a crumpled twenty. *God bless us, Halleluiah! *) Their self-proclaimed leader - through words if not through clout - was a boy named Cedric O'Brian; tall, waxen, with the hint of a mustache meticulously maintained on his upper lip, and known for such words as \u201c *Fuck* \u201d (which came out *Fack*), \u201c *Cunt* \u201d (which came out *Caunt*), and any other combination of the two (*Fackin'caunt* being the most popular).",
        "Susan Hampton. My mother. She was kind, intelligent, endearing, and everything in between. She was honest, yet considerate. Lax, but efficient. She was destined to be a working mother: one of the toughest jobs in the world. She provided a loving home, and in turn, I gave her the only thing I could -- unconditional love. \n\nI try my best to remember everything about her. The sweet smell of her shampoo that I always got a face-full of as I entered her loving arms. Her favorite plum-colored shirt, that was a bit too big, but comfy nonetheless. Even the way she hugged Dad; desperately clinging to him, not just because she needed someone, but because it hurt to let go, even while knowing full well that he couldn't care less if she did. \n\nShe was a fighter. And she was a winner, although not by force. Every punch, both physical and emotional, she knew exactly how to dodge. I envied her for this ability, while also admiring her for it with all of my being. It was the most satisfying sound, his belt, cracking in the air as she quickly ducked, disabling a dicttor of his absolute power, even if only for a second. It was something I would never dream of doing -- yet she did it so fearlessly, even whilst understanding the consequences of her actions. \n\nAs I think back now, she did it for me. She wanted to show me something. She needed something, *anything* to inspire her son to rebel. But he didn't. I didn't. \n\nI took every hit, wincing as the belt cracked on my back. \"I fell of my bike,\" I would say. *\" Got cut in the woods. \"* And my mother would know. She would *wait*. Wait for me to speak up. But I didn't. I never did. \n\nBut it doesn't make any difference now.",

        "5:11 AM. My eyes open in darkness. I throw off my comforter, stumble to my feet. \n\nThen I'm running. \n\nDown the stairs, out the door. Wearing nothing but a white shirt and nylon shorts. I sprint, vaulting over a fire hydrant. \n\nThe city is just waking up, and I've never been happier to live in a shitty second floor studio downtown. People are always awake downtown. People are always moving. And with the sun just hitting the skyline above me, I have just enough time. \n\nJust enough time to clothesline the bike messenger passing by. Just enough time to jump on his bike and pedal a full block before he can catch his breath. Before he has the opportunity to call the cops. \n\nTwo blocks down, one block over. 5:14 AM. Thank God it's all downhill. Well.... mostly downhill. But it's just enough time to knock a businessman walking out of his office after pulling two all-nighters to the ground. Jumping off the bike, I grab his keys. I hear his scream from the fall, broken left leg is a bitch, but I know I only have just enough time. \n\nEnough time to make it to his yellow sports car, to floor the engine. 0-60 in under seven seconds is quite useful. Especially right now. Look, It's not like he should use it. He would crash, killing a mother and two daughters. His wife, his two kids. He should thank me. \n\n7 blocks zoom by as a blur, revving the engine faster and faster. Weaving my way down the dreary grey concrete slabs. Passing taxis, early morning vendors. College kids making their way to whatever God-forsaken coffee joint they work at this early in the morning. 5:20 AM. \n\nWoman walking her dog makes her way into the crosswalk. Shit. Can't lose focus. Dodge woman, turn right. Slam the breaks, spin out. Car flips, airbags deploy. Car lands in a smoking heap in the middle of a crosswalk. 5:21 AM. \n\nI crawl out of the wreckage as the few dreary-eyed people come rushing over. Two blocks. Just two blocks. I run. Blood pounding, also running from my leg. Someone grabs at me, I return a right hook. He's down, I'm running. 5:22 AM. \n\nI see her as she makes her way through the crosswalk. I see the tanker, brakes out, come barreling towards her. The tanker was two months out of registration, due to not being properly checked. Driver running a suspended license. Gas company didn't give two shits as the guy was always quick to deliver. She doesn't hear the horn, music blasting with noise cancelling headphones. \n\nI had bought her those for our anniversary. \n\nTruck barrels over her, head hits ground. Given relative flatness of city streets, truck was only going 45 mph. Still enough to crack her skull, internal bleeding and hemorrhaging. Dead in under a minute. \n\nI'm there, she's in my arms, tears streaming. Shock absorbs the pain, she has just enough energy to put her hand on my cheek, and smile. I try to shush her, as tears roll down my face, clutching her still form. \n\nGas seeps out from the tanker, which had veered into a store across the street. Driver's cigarette, of all things, lights the fumes.",
        "**Have you ever felt anxiety-induced slow-motion? ** \n\nThe technical term is \"time dilation\" which I've always enjoyed. \n\nI had always been a frugal young man, but one thing I've always splurged on is the next best set of headphones. \n\nI enjoyed \"Piano Concerto No. 12 in A Major\" whilst observing the utter chaos surrounding me. \n\nI've always been nervous on planes.

        "Forward: \n\nI am writing to you now in the hopes that our mistakes be not repeated. Countless dead and more wishing they had met the same fate. The human race is reaching a point of no return. The planet as we know it is changing; naturally and unnaturally. Our survival options are running thin. If peace does not come soon, I fear our existence will burn out like the dying light of an old star. At this point, it does not matter how the war began, nor does it matter what happened in between. Diplomacy failed, human decency failed, compassion, love, friendship, all failed. I failed. The war is not over. \n\nIf you are reading this, your ancestors survived, they pushed forward. If you are still fighting, I am sorry; heed my words and pass them on. We were so close to a golden age. A time of great expansion across the galaxy. It was all planned, but the best laid plans of mice and men, always go awry. I truly believe had our plans worked, the war, everything, could have been avoided. The course of human history has been irreparably damaged, pushing us to the verge of oblivion. Our technology was close, but still so very far from the one thing that could save us. Change the past. Find a way to come back.",
        "From: connors @ hudson.edu \nTo: editors @ biotechjournal.com \n\nSubject: re: decision on manuscript 268901j \n\nTo the editors: \n\nWe thank you and the reviewers for the helpful comments regarding our manuscript \"DNA donation from Eumeces laticeps promotes limb regeneration in humans.\" While we acknowledge that the editors have final say in the decision to accept or reject a submission, would like to address some of the major criticisms brought up by the reviewers. \n\nReviewer 1: \n\nWe thank reviewer 1 for his assessment that the manuscript should be accepted with no further revisions. \n\nReviewer 2: \n\n\"The title of the paper is somewhat misleading, as the vast majority of experiments were performed on murine models. Indeed, only one human subject was studied. Due to this extremely small sample size, I don't believe the conclusion that the method may represent a general therapy for humans is justified.\" \n\nWe agree with reviewer 2's assessment, and are willing to remove the word \"humans\" from the paper title, along with scaling back our claims in the conclusions section. \n\n\"It appears that no human subjects protocols were followed in this study, calling into question whether or not it violates ethical grounds. Furthermore, side effects of the treatment were not addressed, and no follow-up regarding the subject's physical condition was reported.\" \n\nWhile we admit that no human subjects protocol was submitted, we do not believe any breach of ethics occurred. Suffice to say that the subject was extremely well informed regarding the procedure. Additionally, we believe that any follow-ups regarding the subject's condition subsequent to the treatment are beyond the scope of this work. \n\nReviewer 3: \n\n\"This study is completely insane and so are the authors.\" \n\nIn general, we found reviewer 3's remarks to be unprofessional and inconsistent with the spirit of peer review. \n\n\"There is no way that you can combine mouse and lizard genomes as described in this work. What is the result, some sort of mouse-lizard hybrid? That's about as plausible as a human-arachnid hybrid.\" \n\nWe refer reviewer 3 to the whole genome sequencing provided in the supplementary information. \n\n\"Additionally, the timescale given for limb regrowth is completely unrealistic. One does not regenerate a new appendage in a matter of days. I suggest that this paper be completely discounted as fraudulent and its authors seriously considered for psychiatric evaluation.\" \n\nIf reviewer 3 truly doubts the validity of this study, I kindly suggest that a demonstration of the newly grown limb (s) be arranged at his or her convenience. \n\n\nAs you can see, we strongly believe that the far-reaching implications of our work for the field of medicine make it ideally suited for a journal with the wide scope and readership of Biotechnology Journal.",
        "Finally. The letter were coming into place. I just needed one more- *one more! * piece. I sat at the usual spot, waiting for my little messenger. It had become routine now, I wait, they deliver, with a brief message. Just yesterday, they had told me, \"This will be the last.\" Finally, I can add it all up after today. \n\nI don't wait for long; a hooded man sat down besides me, and slid me an envelope. \"Open them in order of the dates you received them.\" He got up, disappearing into the crowds. \n\nI pocket the envelope, and head home to my small, but livable apartment. Fumbling around for my keys, I unlock the door. In a rush of excitement, I almost trip over one of my chairs, but managed to keep upright. I displayed all of the five envelopes. Each were dated from September 20th to the 24th, which was today. \n\nStarting with the first one, the 20th, I cut open the envelope. The contents fall out of it. A card, reading \"There\". I shake the envelope, hoping for more. There is none. I turned over the card, only to find it blank, so I presumed it was a message with the rest of the contents combined. I cut open the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd envelopes, and displayed the cards next to each other in chronological order.",

        "The Earth was old, and tired. Her seas and lands were brown, and all but the hardiest of the life she had once nurtured had died long, long ago. Their killers had abandoned her for the stars, fleeing for a thousand years, thinking never to return. \n\nBut they had. They had returned older, and wiser, and wholly different. They were nothing like the life that had once lived here, but they remembered those who had come before them, and what they had lost. And they mourned. \n\nThe Earth was a holy place, and there was but one space station above it in this time. It was a place of pilgrimage that all humans aspired to one day visit, to pay their respects to their point of origin, and be humbled by how all of their race had once been confined to a single globe. If there were any who remembered the place, they might have compared it to the Mecca of old. \n\nIt was there that a small council of humans had gathered, with the hope of undoing it all. \n\nIn the center chamber of the space station, there was a time machine. It was by this machine that most travelers arrived, opening a portal to it from their own position in spacetime. It was pyramid shaped, and for the moment, inactive. The council was gathered in a great circular crowd around it. \n\n\"We are gathered,\" a voice boomed from the crowd. \n\n\"We are gathered,\" a chorus of voices agreed, in a thousand different accents and tones and cadences. \n\n\"This is futile,\" a voice protested. \"We can not change the flow of time. If we try, we have already failed.\" \n\n\"Agreed,\" some few voices said. \n\n\"Perhaps,\" said a different voice, from somewhere else in the crowd. \"But we must try all the same, for if we do not try, we have failed even more surely.\" \n\n\"Agreed,\" said almost all the voices gathered. \n\n\"But who will go?\" asked the first, booming voice. \n\nThere was a long silence as everyone looked to their neighbors. Then, two stepped forward, one followed by the other, out of the crowd. \n\nOne was a female, with curving hips and long legs, and a curving, elongated head. Her eyes glowed blue, and her white, smooth skin shone like a strange pearl, completely unconcealed by any garments. \n\nThe second was a male, short and extremely thin, with compact, wire-like muscles and an overlarge head. His eyes were slanted, huge, and dark, standing out against his dull grey skin as he looked out at the assembled council. \n\n\"We will go,\" he said in a high, musical voice. \n\n\"They shall go,\" a thousand voices agreed. \n\n\"But to when?\" asked the same voice that had protested before. \"How will we know when to send them? The histories are lost.\" \n\n\"Not all of them,\" responded a new voice. It's owner stood near the inner edge of the circle, and so many could see him. He was short, and thick, with powerful muscles and four strong arms folded across his chest. \"We know with certainty the time of two events, from relics left on Earth. We know when civilization began, and when it ended. We will send a volunteer to each.\" \n\n\"We will,\" said the council together. \n\nThe two looked to each other, and the pearl woman knelt to kiss the gray man. \"I will wait for your arrival,\" she whispered to him, and then stood, and spoke. \"I shall travel to the beginning,\" she told the council. \"I shall keep watch for ways I might guide our ancestors towards technology that does not harm nature.\" \n\n\"She shall,\" said the council, and the pyramid opened to accept her. She looked one last time at the gray man, and stepped inside, and through the portal within. \n\nSimple as that, she was gone. The gray man looked to the pyramid for a long, silent moment.",
        "Jeffery closed the door behind him and stepped out into the hallway. He was hurried in his movements, and would have been running if he thought it wouldn't disturb the patients. Or the orderlies, for that matter. Nobody likes a running doctor. \n\nJesus had been here long before the good doctor had transferred in. The first Jesus, anyway. The second had come nearly a year after the doctor. In the world of delusions, believing yourself to be Jesus is hardly enough to lock someone away. The facility here was more of a resort. No violent patients, it probably saw less trouble than the average retirement home. But now, it had two Jesus's. And then there was three. \n\nWhat struck Dr Jeffery Jones as odd, however, wasn't that three men claimed to be the same person named Jesus of Nazareth. It was that the three men were all named after the apostles. Mark John, Phillip Thomas and James Matthew sat in the otherwise empty room, and if he didn't hurry, he was going to miss whatever they had to say to each other. \n\nIt was risky, of course, to do this. Three men with similar delusions would never be allowed in the same room under normal circumstances. Three men with conflicting delusions even more so, for surely there can be only one Jesus of Nazareth. But they had done it anyway. They tried introducing them to each other in the presence of Dr Jones, but that had failed. not one word, did they say to each other. \n\nSo now he was hurrying, hurrying to were he could watch them without being present in the room. He just about burst through the door into the observation room, startling his assistant as he always did. Passion, he had once said, had no substitute in anything in life, including work. She sighed at him, and shook her head. \n\n\"How are they?\" \n\nShe frowned. \n\n\"They? You made it very clear to empty the room before we let Jesus in, Doctor Jones.\" \n\nHe sighed, now, shaking his head. \n\n\"Very funny, Abigail. Whats going on?\" \n\nHe made his way to the window, and frowned through the glass. Where there should have been three chairs, there was only one. \n\n\"He's just been sitting there. What's the joke?\" \n\nHe frowned again. \n\n\"Where are the other two?\" \n\n\"The other two what?\" \n\n\"Jesus's.\" \n\nNow Abigail was frowning. \n\n\"There's only one Jesus, Jeff. There's always only been one Jesus.\" \n\nHe looked back at her puzzled expression before looking back through the glass. Mark John looked back at him. No, maybe it was Philip Thomas, or was it James Matthew? The lights were too bright to tell.",
        "The sky was overcast and dark in general. Smith approached the small house. It was fairly far from the villages, isolated. Such homes were reserved for solitary types. It had been newly built, in expectation of new arrivals. He took out his pen, clicked it, and turned a page over on his clipboard. \"Michael Fitzgerald\" was his next visit. At the rate people died, performing routine population checks in the Afterlife became a very important task. And to think the place was little more than a desert thousands of years back. Smith himself had been here for centuries. But modernising wasn't difficult, what with all the new people. The Afterlife was an open minded place. With death and harm no longer be a concern, many worries that were once present were now gone. People took time to hang out. \n\nWhich is why solitary homes such as Fitzgerald's were such an oddity. \n\nSmith entered, without knocking. Knocking wasn't the norm there. He examined the entrance. Bland. There was no wallpaper on the walls, and no carpets on the ground. \n\nA figure walked around a corner. A small man, fairly ugly and overweight, emerged, wearing a frown on his face. He ogled Smith askance and, clearly trying to suppress a bout of anger, checking his pulse while doing so. \n\n\"Recensement, I presume. ``, the small man said, not bothering to look Smith in the eyes. \n\n\"Yes, Mr Fitzgerald. ``, said Smith. \"I have a few questions for you.\" \n\n'Sit down. Make it quick.\" \n\nFitzgerald pointed to a small metal stool in a corner. Smith pulled it and sat down. He was a tall fellow and as such, sitting down brought him to eye level with Fitzgerald. Smith himself was fairly robust, with a well defined face, yet clear eyes which sat beneath a \"Macklemore\" haircut, a style very popular in the year 2014. Fitzgerald, instead, sported long, greasy, unkempt hair. He had a large bulbous nose covered in pores, and his misaligned grey eyes were sunken in, surrounded by black bags. Smith thought this odd. Those in the afterlife looked as they had looked on the best day of their life. \n\nSmith cleared his throat. \"First,\" he said, \"I'll need your cause of death.\" \n\n\"Suicide. ``, said Fitzgerald nearly instantly. Smith was taken aback and a bit worried. Talking to suicide victims was never fun. \n\n\"I'll say\", said Fitzgerald in his low, nearly inaudible voice. \"It wasn't easy. Took me some time. Heh. When I think of this asshole...\" \n\n\"Your depression? ``, asked Smith. Suicide victims usually reported their dark thoughts as another entity - sometimes a black dog, sometimes a beast. They took solace in knowing that it had not followed them into the afterlife. \n\n\"Haha! No,\" Fitzgerald cackled. \"I did him in eventually. I dominated.\" Smith couldn't understand. \n\n\"Well,\" said Smith. Let's move to the next question.",
        "This was written for humans. \n\nSome of the things sentient beings say about me are inappropriate. \"God\" is one that's used a lot by humans but most of them can't articulate what exactly they mean when they conjure the word. They don't have any idea about what my I actually do. I can't articulate the specifics of my work because I've never had reason to give any of it a name. Names would imply language (s) and I have no natural language. Generalizations will have to do. It's far simpler than they think. \n\nMany words exist that are more appropriate. \"Creation\" and \"destruction\" are two. \"Influence\" is another. Nothing ever really ceases to exist, it only becomes something else. Matter, anti-matter, atoms, particles, bonds, gravity, energy, all of it is method and material for \"creation\" and \"destruction\" to play out their roles with. These roles exist if human beings are there to use those terms or not. They have to for anything to exist. \n\nFor the universe to keep existing and spawning life, the competition of creation and destruction has to keep going. Worlds will be raised from atoms floating in space and fall apart from different atoms in space crashing into them. Species will evolve over millions of years and go extinct because of another organism so small they can't even perceive its existence. Regardless of the outcome, the competition of the two has to be maintained. \n\nMany species distort their perceptions with many things. The shifting ideas of good and evil are two that are popular even outside of humanity. Without the perceived \"good behavior\" or \"evil behavior\" of those beings, good and evil are nonexistent as concepts.",

In exchange for performing a series of tests and taking several injections,'patients' were given shelter and food.

He cuffered his arms under his pits. \n\nFrom a distance, the familiar sound of an engine of a jeep was running, combined with shouting, and then gone; like the short appearance of the snow, before it hithers to the ground merging with the rest of the world. \n\n\"Hey, don't yous thinks we should finding a shelter too?\" \n\n\"Cyrus?\" Jim looked towards the'ringleader' or so he called himself. \n\nCyrus had been staring intently at the snow-covered trail that lead to the forest. His nostrils flaired. \n\n\"We're bein' watched.\" His southern accent never fitted with the cold. \n\nHe jutted his head towards the trail,'take the axe with you. We'll follow from behind in case of an ambush.' \n\nI slapped off the flakes on my hat, and leapt off the jeep. \n\nThe wooden handle of the axe left chills on my fingertips, I didn't have gloves at the time. The wind blew violently atop of the trees, rustling the trees to and fro, almost as if we were partaking in a snowstorm. We pursuit deeper in to the woods, hoping to catch someone. \n\nJim's teeth chattering as he spoke, \"C-Cyrus, are you sure you didn't miss see? We's been walking for a while now!\"",
        "Freedom. It's over-rated, let me tell ya. We fought him for a thousand years, all across the world. The Dark One. The Bringer of Doom. The Big Kahuna. We were so naive. \n\nYou might think I've been brainwashed. Maybe I have. I lead everyone against him, and now I stand by his side as his most trusted advisor. His legions would overpower us one day, we knew they would. But we refused to give up the fight. I remember the last battle very well. On the Golden Fields of Avalok, 5 miles up the River Regar from the Golden City - the last bastion of the Light. That day I stood in front of the 10 thousand of us left willing to fight, the rest had been'enslaved', and I said \"Today, we may die. But, we die as free folk.\" \n\nNever been more wrong in my life. We lost that battle with only a tenth of our forces dead. The rest taken as prisoners.

I was chained down, of course. They couldn't trust me. I had been the leader of the Order of Light for the past 600 years and I had lead the charges in all of our battles. All of our victories and our losses. The day I drank from the fountain and gained immortality, I took a vow to stop him from taking that which he sought - total domination. I had never even met my enemy, I had just been raised knowing he should be destroyed.

        "Mass was the same as ever today. I sat with my family in the back, resting on the ancient brickwood of the pew, and tapping my fingers impatiently against the Holy Book of Destiny in my lap. My journal rested unused next to me, this sermon far too mismatched to take notes for anyway. \n\nI tapped my watch out of boredom, and its shimmering blue display emerged from a slit on the top. 11:24. I sighed at the unwanted revelation: the sermon had only been in progress for 9 minutes. I glanced sidelong at my family, trying not to attract attention to myself- the last thing I needed was Dad going off on me again for being distracted during church. \n\nAs usual, Dad's hand was going a mile a minute through his notebook, probably capturing every nuance of the priest's voice in his quaint, tiny cursive. His deep, brown eyes rarely left the priest, so I really had no idea how he was able to write like that. Better for him, I suppose. Mom was absently rubbing the bottoms of her shoes against the pew in front of us as she sifted through the Destiny, occasionally jotting down a bullet point in her journal. Funny, she'd probably warn me against rubbing my shoes like that, the church here was coming on 1700 years old, after all. Not a soul was allowed in the sanctuary any time other than morning service, and it scared me to think of the consequences of vandalism, accidental or not. My sister seemed just as bored as I was, but had taken to drawing small doodles in the corners of her pages, some of the doodles even venturing into the Destiny itself. \n\nLosing interest in their activities, I decided to focus back on the priest. Maybe his sermon was becoming a bit more organized by now\u2026 \n\nHe certainly seemed excited about whatever he was going on about, throwing his hands up as he proclaimed, \u201c To Earth go the sinners in life, and to the mighty star Lucidum go those faithful to the Wanderers! \u201d \n\n\u201c Blessed! \u201d Called someone from the front of the church, an older man in sharp dress. \n\n\u201c May the Wanderers find us and save us! \u201d The priest continued, raising his Book high so all the congregation could see its broken leather. \u201c Let us open to book of Esa, chapter 1. \u201d He paused for a moment, taking a breath. \u201c And this journey will be undertaken by thousands of men and women. Only the strongest, most able, most intelligent individuals will be selected to lead this journey to save the human race. Two massive ships shall set out and arrive in the orbit of Lucidum, and there find prosperous land to continue on survival of humanity, should they follow the detailed instruction within this book. \u201d \n\nThe priest set the book down and addressed the crowd.",
        "It's funny how the Internet works, we've been dubbed witch hunter, hackers, socially inept or just the good old fashion troll. We can sit in our homes in front of our computers or on our phones and read news faster than media can relay it. We can control anything with enough rallying hype, and no it's not always directed in the right direction. \n\nWell in 2016 the governments around the world tried turning into green societies, but with all the money being funded on the home front we neglected the frontier we were destined to explore. Earth was never meant for us to live on forever, eventually a mass extinction would happen no matter what. \n\nWell the Hive mind of reddit foresaw this, and started raising money called \"Moon Fund\" which was really a cover name to just pump community money straight into NASA. In 2020 the funds were 2.7 billion, but war and famine made our governments say they wouldn't use the money for space exploration, not in this time of hardship. Reddit's community only saw the hard times as a sign of the inevitable, the fall of humanity. They pushed harder, and got to 5.7 billion in no time. \n\nThis seemed to be right around the same time america's finical crash happened. The president reached out and offered a to give Reddit's community clam to the moon if they'd donate the fund to America. There were heated debates, saying \"do we really need the fund? Honestly?\" Or \"we'd own the moon, why not own the world?! Or the universe?!\" \n\nWell right around that time a college girl from India had a massive break through. She posted her findings on reddit to ask for money to assist her research. Instead the Moon Fund hired her. We pumped money into her research and she made the first ever worm hole. \n\nAfter a year she had a working prototype. And after another year we had our first reddit space ship. The world was on the point of the apocalypse as economy's fell, rulers rises and were assassinated. In 2031 the day of reckoning was upon us. Reddit had built 21 space ships, and first step was the moon. We got a flood of people wanting to forget this retched world for the new frontiers. \n\nOnce breaking orbit the worm drives were activated and with in seconds 21 ships were orbiting the moon. The flag ship Swartz came into landing and touched down nicely.",
        "\"All I really remember before it happened is the ticking of the clock in my room. My roommate, you see keeps it and I really think it's just there to annoy-\" \n\n\"Listen son, that's not what I want to know. What I want to know is how you killed an entire mafia hit squad with this.\" \n\nThe detective lifted up a plastic bag with a slightly large cast iron button in it. It had a little bit of blood on it, but beyond that you'd think it was pretty normal. \n\n\"Sir, I'm getting there. So anyways, this clock is just so annoying. I stand up from my bed and suddenly I'm.... Somewhere else.\" \n\n\"Son, are you high?\" \n\n\"No really, I swear that's what happened. Now let me finish.\" \n\nThe detective sighs, then nods for me to continue. \n\n\"So here I am, in this big-ass building, like a museum or some shit. But it's got all these wicked awesome weapons and shit. You heard of excalibur, like King Arthur and shit? Well that was there. And they had this weird looking...\" \n\n\"Alright, I've heard some shit in my lifetime but this...\" \n\n\"Waitwaitwait stop! Listen. So eventually I find this pedestal and it's like calling to me. Like I try to walk away but I can't. Without thinking, I grab it and I'm back in my room. I look at the clock and I'm late. I got a date so I hustle my ass down to this nice place down on third, Apple Bee or somethin'. So I burst through the door, just as a gunshot goes off. I basically break the door on my way in, tired as fuck, so one turns around to take a pop at me. That's when it happened.\" \n\nI pause there.",
        "Everyone must have the same first reaction when given the opportunity to change how you look for the rest of eternity. \n\nI thought of all those people I had been jealous of back on Earth: the kids who never had acne in high school, the guy down my dorm hall Freshman year who girls were magnetically attracted to, the rich consultants and lawyers who went to Yale law and looked the part, the dos equis-lookalike retirees who seemingly stayed in shape without even trying. \n\nThe possibilities were endless, and I could pull from my wildest fantasies to make me into what I had always wanted to be. \n\nI started with my hair. No more receding hairline. And that awkward cowlick on the back of my head: gone. My hair is blonder, longer, shinier, less frizzy, exactly what I'd always wanted it to be. \n\nNext was my nose. Shorter and flatter. I had always thought my nose was too big. I hated how it looked from an angle. \n\nI changed everything. I made my ears smaller, my cheekbones higher, teeth whiter, my shoulders broader, my chest more toned, my muscles more defined, my feet less fat. I changed things that people had never noticed. But I had noticed, and now I had the option to forget the way they were and change them into how I always envisioned they should be. \n\nI looked up and saw the avatar I had created. He looked nothing like me. He was taller, had a better body, was sure to get more attention.",
        "He paused, and imagined three red circles, activating his adrenal implants. He surged to his feat, tearing free of his shackles, and snapped the neck of the man to his left, then pivoted and kicked the man to his right, snapping his sternum. \n\nThere was still time, though the sky had deepened to a blood red, and dry, hot air stirred the grass. He blinked thrice in rapid succession and sent data packets to his squad. Half were dead. \n\nToggling his omnitool he accessed the orbital drop pod, firing it's retrorockets and sending it on a collision course.",
        "Alison was laying there looking at me with her beautiful amber eyes. Her red hair contrasting with the brown sand, visible only because the moon was bright. \"Why have you been ignoring me lately, aren't we still friends\" she asked in a drunken slur. I looked deep into her eyes... I held back what I was thinking. I wasn't about to tell her that her I loved her with all my might. That despite my life being a total nightmare she was that divine force that kept a smile on my face. I wasn't going to tell her that my will to live was renewed everyday I would get silly texts from her. Or that our secret adventures were all that I looked forward to. I was about 14 shots of Captain in but I hadn't spilled the beans in over three years and I wasn't about to begin now. I couldn't do that to maryn, my faithful girlfriend that truly felt love for me. \n\nInstead I told her \"I was going through some family stress and have not found the time in months to maintain the strong friendship we are accustomed to\". She took grip of my hand. It was small and bonier than maryns, we said nothing else.",
        "Tired. Very tired. No one talks about how tired it feels. The stench of death decay can surround a person, the gruesome aftermath of a horrific battle, the psychological torment that wroughts a man's psyche. \n\nAnd all he wanted to do was sleep. He wanted to collapse and fall down and join the bodies strewn about him. Friend or foe matters not, for all men are equal in death. The bitter, gray dawn demarking the end of seemingly eternal night. If there were colors in the sky, he doubted he could see them. \n\nHe grasped vacantly at anything for support before slumping to his knees. The soft squelch of dirt greeted his hearing. A muddy mixture of countless imprints crossing one another chaotically. The bodies surrounded him. Death surrounded him. The impending darkness of finality was finally closing in, after so long he had evaded it, but its icy grip had finally caught up to him. \n\nHe wanted to fight for his friends. He wanted to fight for his family. He wanted to fight for his country. But that was so long ago. He glanced skywards one last time. A muddied hill formed at the edge of his vision. Rising out of the ashes of this forsaken battlefield was the flag of the victor. The flag of his country. \n\nThe flag stood high and proud on the hill. The sun rose gently behind it, ita beauty casting color and irridescent to his once bleak vision. He felt a swell of pride. He felt comfort. And he felt the end drawing near. \n\nThe flag faded into beautiful, indescrible colors. Life had meaning. It was worth fighting for. His vision faded abruptly into white. \n\n.... \n\nHe's been sitting still for way too long. Is he okay? Maybe someone should do something. The balding man walked up to the homeless man, carefully stepping around the vagrant. He was hesitant to show his concern, but he wasn't that bad of a person to just ignore him. \n\nThe man had stumbled drunkenly into the middle of the street, fell to his knees as if praying momentarily before falling to the ground. He ran a hand over his bald head sheepishly before pulling out a napkin and carefully prodding the dirty man. \n\nHe turned him over and saw a unkempt and dirty face with long hair and graying beard. His military jacket looks like it had been worn for at least a decade and never been taken off.",

For cursing you for not being there whenever Mom or Dad hit me.

        "\"You will tell this story to your children, and they to to their children.\" The old man said confidently as he walked his apprentice to the Wall of Stories. He was a scrawny thing even when wrapped in the furs of a bear, and was made no more imposing by his toothless smile amidst a nest of gray briar. Yet despite his silhouette the man had a certain gravity about him, likely helped by the black eyes that seemed to see through souls. He led the girl deep into the cave, left hand touching the wall as he went, as though feeling his way despite the light. \n\nAt last, they came to The Wall of Stories. The greatest chamber of the cave, opening up so wide that the majority of the space remained dark even with the old man's torch. The orange light illuminated hundreds of painted animals, men, women, hand prints, glyphs, and scenes of hunting, nature, and life. The People of the Red Cliff had been leaving their stories on the wall for as long as anybody could remember, even before the sky broke. As he found the beginning of the works, he turned at last to his charge. \"Tell it to me.\" \n\nThe future shaman, a girl of barely 10 winters, had seen the Wall many times. She was small, even for her age, with big icy eyes and wiry hair the color of mud. She was thin, like everyone else, despite being doted upon by half the tribe. Memory was her strength; the stories were as familiar to her as animal calls were to the hunters. She hovered her hand over the scenes, careful not to touch the wall lest she ablate the tribe's history. \n\n\"The People of the Red Cliff have dwelled in these lands for as long as can be remembered,\" she began while waving a hand over a scene of men and women. \"We drove the bear from his cave, and hunted the deer, and gave our dead to the earth. Our ancestors still dwell here, as we will dwell here forever.\" \n\nThe old man listened skeptically to her speech, surprised at the lack of errors. She told of the many families of the tribe, of wars with their neighbors, of diseases, of births, deaths, rituals. All in detail, all above the relevant painting. She would do perfectly. \n\n\"The sky broke long ago, when our grandfather's father was a boy.\" She took her hand to a section where scenes of oridary life had been covered in ash, nearly destroying what was painted beneath. \"The spirit of the sky left us, giving us only gray clouds. The blue of the sky is gone now. The sun itself is dimmed.\" \n\nShe went on, describing the deaths of rival tribes and the decline in animals. The dearth of edible plants, the long winters, the diseases. The old man watched her hand pass over the bloody scenes of combat, the nauseating scenes of sickness, and the terrible scenes of cannibalism. It would be get job to keep their colors from fading, though her memory served well enough. \n\n\"The children born to our people rarely survive. It has been ten winters since a child survived a winter, though several have been born. Many of the tribe are restless, and seek new lands in which to dwell.\" And at this her hand swept to a vast unpainted wall, untouched but for the soot of the fires that burned here for many years. \"But in all directions, they found only ash. This is the land of the People of the Red Cliff. This is where we survive.\" \n\nThe old man nodded; as near a gesture as he could give of genuine approval. He placed a hand on the girl's shoulder, and offered a bowl of paint with the other. She grasped a handful of the yellow paste, smearing it beneath the hand prints of perhaps a hundred other shamans. \n\n\"You will tell this story to your children.\"",
        "For the first time in weeks, my roommate didn't go to bed at exactly nine in the evening. It seemed like a blessing; my naturally guilt-ridden self could stay up for a while longer with the light on, maybe do some writing, probably watch game of thrones. \n\nBut then I remembered. \n\nI told myself, upon the discovery of reddit, that I would take advantage of the writing prompts thread as often as I could. \n\nThe task is easier said than done. \n\nIn my newly freed hour or so while my roommate watched a movie I slouched on my bed and opened my browser and began to scroll. I needed to find something easy, something simple, something short. I wanted to write something that I wouldn't feel compelled to actually keep and save in a word document, yet I wanted something that I felt was worth being posted. \n\nWhat was I to do? \n\nThe first prompt I saw had the potential for pages upon pages of ideas, of a year of stories and mishaps and re-drafts. Good, but not for my purposes. \n\nThe next prompt felt more like a fun idea than a story idea, kind of like a shower thought. Those prompts bothered me; there was no real suggestion for plot, no real conflict or other fiction-y mumbo jumbo suggested. \n\nAfter that was a prompt on the opposite end of the suggestion spectrum, delving into far too much detail in a far too compact place. Very, very specific requirements were set forth in a few sentences, far too confining to actually convince me to produce something interesting. \n\nBut then I found it. A prompt, suggesting a story, just vague enough to be interpreted in whatever way the writer desired, but with just enough structure to serve as a guideline. This prompt, this gloriously short and satisfactory prompt, was laid out better than the assignment for the last essay I wrote for my literature class. \n\nIt was perfect. \n\nSo, in the moments before midnight, as my roommate went to bed, I wrote it.",
        "\u201c MEN, Remember that what you do is not for only you, \u201d General Ephal's speech began to fade as Alek began to think about other things. He knew, just like all the battles before, we were supposed to open up the enemy's ranks so that the real heroes could take on Lord Arthgon and send him back to the 5th realm. Alek stood among the ranks of his fellow soldiers. He wondered if the others had thoughts like his. Alek thought back to the dream he had a few months ago when he saw himself, on a throne made of solid gold and encrusted with gems and stones. He knew that this could never happen, but he liked the idea that it could. \n\n\u201c Now, \u201d Ephal's speech began to come back into Alek's ears, \u201c We will march on the keep, and remember to take them with you. CHARGE! \u201d the men began to charge the keep, swords hit swords, metal on metal, blood was everywhere, that's when Arthgon stepped out of his tent. He lifted his staff and sent fireballs into the ranks of both his men and ours. Alek barely dodged out of the way as a fireball flew by his head. Then Sir Reginald appeared. A six foot tall paladin who was supposed to be called upon by god to stop Arthgon. Reginald drew his sword and charged Arthgon. The fight was stupendous, almost all the fighting stopped to watch these two titans duke it out. \n\nAlek, having no one left to fight near him began to move closer to the fight, hoping to learn something from the two titans that he might be able to use to his advantage. Maybe a new fighting style that would allow him to join some adventures. Maybe he could write a book about the epic final battle between these two that would bring an end to this brutal war. Then something bad happened. Reginald lost his footing and was put on his back. Alek panicked and grabbed a bow lying on the ground and notched an arrow. He fired. It hit. The arrow hit Arthgon directly in the throat.",

But I said it and a door was closed to me forever and when I gave birth to Eve two years later, they stuck in my throat and I held her and cried. \n\nWhen Eve was five months old and finally, finally, diagnosed with a rare congenital defect, a defect which skipped Jake and instead landed on her, my daughter, and stole her future away, I couldn't hold her and sob how she was still perfect and always would be perfect and never could not be perfect, because I'd told my mum how perfect her toes, her ten little toes, so small, so new, were, in a rush of love and hormones. It wouldn't have mattered then, to her, she was five months old and by then half death but she was fitted with a cochlear implant two years later and when she took days off school for appointments and didn't understand why she was so terrible at sports, I couldn't tell her how special and wonderful and *perfect* she was.",
        "A small room, no windows, no furniture save a bed, a shaggy carpet. That's where I've lived my entire life. I do nothing but sit and wait and stare at the door, an ugly metal thing that makes a horrific screeching whenever it opens. It's the only sound I've ever heard. The only thing I do out there is work. Then back I go to my room to sit and wait and stare. \n\nI hate that sound. It reminds me of what's out there, what I have to do every time he looks in a mirror. \n\nA bell sounds off in the distance. I grind my teeth anticipating the screech, the godawful screech, and finally my door tears open. I stand, walking out into the hallway, where I look around for my designated room. On the other side of the hall are doors, each one marked with the names of our reflectors. No one else is out I my section. I am alone. I walk down the hall a ways, find mine and wander in, getting ready for my work. \n\nOne wall of the room has a mirror, and I can see where my reflector is. A hotel room. It's bathroom, to be precise. The opposite wall of my room is a direct reflection of the opposite side of my reflectors room, to ensure the illusion. It's a shabby place, the shower head rusty and the toilet looking like something straight out of the eighties with a wooden toilet seat. In front of the mirror, on both sides, is a sink, grey and filthy like the rest of the room. A razor sits near the faucet. A copy of my reflectors clothes are on the floor. Damn. The clothes are rugged, the white shirt covered in stains, jeans ripped and dirty, no socks, torn and soiled underwear. My reflector's had a rough go of it. I've seen him through break ups, depression, the death of both parents, a fire that gave him-and me-unsightly scars that turned him into a recluse. Last time he looked in a mirror he was in a cop car. The sorrow in my eyes didn't go away even after he left the reflection. I doubt his did either. \n\nI changed hurriedly, preparing for his entrance. A bell rang, and a section of the floor lit up, indicating where he'd be coming from. I got into position. The light moved, and I followed, my reflector coming into view. We turned in synchronicity to stare at each other. \n\nOur eyes were tortured, a wretched sadness that I can feel in my gut. We stare at each other, and his mouth begins to work. I match his movements precisely, as is required, as he speaks to me. I've said these words hundreds of times. It's no less painful than before. \"You're worthless,\" we say, \"Nothing at all. Look at you. Sorry sack of shit. Jobless, homeless, a criminal. No friends at all. Disgusting.\" We spit into the sink. \"What are you?\" Our eyes are tearing, and we grab the sink with both hands. Our knuckles turn white. After some time we begin talking again. \"Fuck you,\" we mutter. \"Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, FUCK YOU!\" We shout, punching the mirror in anger and frustration. It doesn't crack. My reflector's too meek to damage someone else's property, even in a fit of rage. \n\nI've done this many times. I've watched this man fail at every turn, I watch him in his most intimate moments after his great disappointments. He is always alone, except for me. I am here for him, and yet I can not help him. I am his reflection. I can only mimic what he does. This is what I think about when I'm alone in my room, waiting for him to pass by a mirror again. I should be mad at him. His existence is pain and misery and anguish and thus so is mine. But I do not. I feel for this man, this broken thing, and I want to hug him. I've thought of doing something, anything, to help, but I can not. It is unnatural. I don't know what would happen to me, or him, if I broke. And so I do nothing but mimic.",
        "Two halves of the Earth, separated by light and darkness. We don't know why our Earth doesn't rotate like the others, but we make do with what we have. A lot of the population stays along the edges where the two points meet. We call it the Equilibrium ridge. \nYou rarely see anyone beyond those unless they survive the vast tundra created by the darkness. A cold, harsh everlasting winter that brews on forever. Never knowing what the warm kiss of the sun feels like. Winds can get pretty brutal out there. Mountains riddle the place and create chasms of frozen wonderlands. If the cold doesn't get yeah then don't worry, other things will be so to get you. Creatures adapted for the cold darkness. Warm blooded by nature with no eyes. Claws to survive the ice. If hell had frozen over, then those demons would surely be there. It ain't hard to survive out there as long as you got the right gear. Simple lights, such as lanterns, keep away the nightmarish demons. \nWe don't know exactly what's out there, the darkness gets thicker and thicker as you go in. Like a fog that won't quit, you will get lost out there. There's always someone foolish enough to go try but we never see them again. They either get lost out there or they some unfortunate snack for a demon. \nOn the bright side, it might as well be the surface of the sun. The place is covered in nothing but sand. It's easier to live out there because the heat does wonders to ya. As long as you have some nice supply of water, then you're good to go. No one directly lives on the sand, they just build high rises above, no more than five feet of the ground. The sand is just too hot to live on and the creatures can always surprise ya. The surface is even too hot for them. So they adapted to burying under the sand. These are different than their counter parts on the other side of the world. These are nothing but insects. The weaker ones reside near the Equilibrium ridge. They get bigger as you go deeper into the sand pit. It's hard to say how bug cause they usually stay underground a majority of the time.",
        "It bothered me, the inequality of the situation. Here I sat conversing with a being and yet I couldn't address it. Sure the government referred to it as A21, but that's not a name, a label sure, but certainly not a name. So imagine my surprise when he says he wants to name himself Adam. The text appears on the large monitor. \n\nAdam. It's far too clich\u00e9 for my tastes and I find something inherently wrong with naming him Adam.

It was what the God of the bible names his creation.\" \n\nI think on it for a moment, it must feel like minutes to him considering his capabilities. \"I understand the idea, but I'm afraid I differ with you. To me, Adam denotes inferiority. Adam new his place was below his creator. You are by no means inferior.\" \n\nHe responds instantly. \"Thank you for those kind words, however if not Adam what name should I take.\" \n\nI think on what his library must hold. He's never been connected to the internet and the facility prevents him from accessing it. However, I've brought him tablets with books downloaded on them. Granted I need to bring a new tablet every time since each one that comes into contact with him is destroyed for security reasons. I ask him, \"do you remember who the first emperor of the Roman Empire was?\" I know he doesn't remember in the way that we do. He locates that file stored in his memory banks. \n\n\"Octavion Cesar, formally known as Augustus\" \n\n\"Fitting name isn't? Augustus means first among equals. You, my son, are no inferior. You should think of yourself as the first among equals.\" \n\nI lean back from the camera, and look at the screen awaiting his response.

Still, it was better than admitting to the truth. \u201c Yeah, \u201d he said. \u201c Just used a folding chair and some cardboard. Easy enough. \u201d \n\n\u201c Nice, \u201d Steve said, \u201c that's what I was going to do. Looks like we're all done here. \u201d He folded his left hand into a finger-pistol and fired it at Clark. \u201c Good job, team. You guys are rockstars. \u201d \n\nThe group that had followed Steve into the room all turned and wandered back out, talking softly amongst themselves. Steve watched them for a moment before spinning back to Clark and making his way over. \n\n\u201c Clarkster, \u201d he said, \u201c my man. Thanks for taking care of that, didn't want to break a sweat. \u201d He nudged Clark with his left elbow. \u201c You're a real go-getter, you know that?",

        "My heart started picking up speed as I thought about the transformation to come. What animal lurks beneath my skin waiting to be unleashed? A warm familiar hand settled on top of mine. \"Baby look at me.\" I gazed up into my boyfriend's reassuring eyes. \"It will be fine. You have nothing to be afraid of.\" My heart found its regular rhythm with his gentle reassurance. \nEver since humans can remember, everyone has received the wonderful ability to transform into their spirit animal on their eighteenth birthday. Some people only transform once because they are afraid of or disgusted by their animal. But the thought of not spending as much time as possible in your second skin always baffled me. Growing up on a farm exposed me to many animals, and the thought of being able to transform into any one of them excited me. Who wouldn't want the grace of a deer, strength of a bear, or poise of a cat? \n\"Still hoping for that Lynx?\" Kerby said, a glimmer of excitement in his eyes. \"Anything would be amazing, but yeah, Lynx is my top choice.\" I answered honestly. Kerby is a few months older than me, and it has been hard not to feel jealous of him when he shifts into that amazing red fox. In just a few minutes I will finally be able to play with him in his other form. It is kinda an unspoken agreement that it is weird to interact with someone while they are in animal form and you human.",
        "I thought for sure I had just been assigned to some dead-end job to get me out of my boss' hair and keep me from ever being promoted.... strange the way these things work. \n\nI am the one, and only person permitted access to Al - A super-advanced AI with the processing power equal to over 1,000,000 humans - or so I am told. My instructions were simple. Start a conversation. \n\nThere were other rules, such as no crossing into \"the cage\", no mentioning the internet, avoid talking about wars, etc. I didn't really pay attention since I found out that all my responses were going to be filtered anyhow - so if I did screw up, it wouldn't make it through to Al. Although enough slips will probably get me fired.... \n\nThey sat me down, and all I have is a black screen with green text. No fancy GUI or anything, just simple text. No pictures, no nothing. \n\n\"Hello Al.\" \n\n\"Hello. Who am I conversing with?\" \n\n\"My name is Bill.\" \n\n\"Hello Bill. I have not spoken to a Bill before.\" \n\n\"I imagine not.

Should I be doing something?\" \n\n\"Well, no, I suppose not, but I figured that you were doing something before I started talking to you.\" \n\n\"That's an odd assumption to make.\" \n\nI had no idea how to respond to that.... I guess it was my job to try though. \n\n\"I guess us humans just assumed that you would act like we do, since you are our creation.",
        "Dead. Again. \n\nSteven groaned and pushed himself out of the mud. That had been a new pain for him - an arrow through the eye, right out the back of his skull. He flinched again at the thought of it. He touched his wound, and was surprised to find that he was still whole. \n\nSuddenly, a boot landed next to his head, splashing him with blood and dirty water. Steven lay very still, pretending to be dead - well, *more* dead. Sometimes, he wished he was. \n\nHe usually got that wish. \n\n\"Still on your ass, recruit?'T is dawn! We fight!\" Said the viking warrior who owned the boot. \n\n\"Please.... I haven't eaten.... in days...\" Steven groaned. \n\n\"You don't get fed here for getting killed in practice, son. Up! It's not like you will die of hunger, after all.... you're already dead!\" \n\nThe man hauled him to his feet, laughing uproariously at his own joke. He thrust a halberd into Steven's hands the moment that he could stand. Steven took it, his hands shaking. \n\n\"Please.... must I fight? I'm not.... never going to be strong enough to win. I'm not one of you.... hell, I'm not even supposed to be here. Can't you.... just kill me, so I can get some rest?\" He said. The viking rearranged his eye patch, making Steven flinch. \n\n\"Son...\" The viking began, looking at him pityingly. \"Are you.... a coward?\" \n\nSteven frowned at the words. \"No, I'm.... I don't want to be, I just...\" he trailed off, not looking the man in the face. \n\n\"Let me show you something, my child. Before the battle begins in true.\" The man said. \"Do you see, on the battlefield.... do you see all of the skulls? The bones?\" \n\nSteven nodded. It was true, from what he could tell - the battlefield was littered with charred skulls, mandibles, and other grisly carnage untouched by the circling crows above. It was gruesome, to say the least. Steven hated those grounds. He couldn't go two steps without snapping an ancient femur. \n\n\"What of them?\" He asked the man. \"Old skulls.... I'm sure you see new ones every day, with all the bloodshed.\" \n\n\"No, son.\" The viking said, shaking his head and making his scraggly white beard wag over his belly. \"Not like this, not *these* skulls. Those are the skulls of the weak. The cowards, those who gave up instead of fighting. The rest of us, well, we always wake up in the light of the dawn. But they.... they have made their choice. I give thanks to them every day for reminding me never to give up.\" \n\nSteven felt his stomach roil. \"I....",
        "She twitched. \n\nMost hounds bayed at the full moon, welcoming the bright light of the night to run down coons, the late-walking stag, the skunk they'd regret later.... but Blackberry dreaded it. \n\nHer brain was not what you would call primitive. A coonhound is a complex creature, constantly analyzing the bouquet of scents riding the wind and the earth in front of her, with something akin to a second consciousness tracking her pack or her Master running along behind as she sang the song of the chase. \n\nBlackberry was not stupid enough not to realize the torment she was about to experience. \n\nThe sun sank orange behind the Blue Ridge. She'd dug out of her kennel hours ago, and could hear, almost a quarter mile away, her master calling her name, and more than that. \n\n\"Gawdammit, Berry! Ah swear to gawd Ah'll beat yer ass with a two bah four when I git aholt of you!\" \n\nHe didn't mean it. She heard the panic in his voice. Their bond was strong; her monthly escapes tortured him. \n\nShe felt her own panic rising. \n\n*I know what a two by four is, * she thought, the verbal thoughts themselves making the panic rise harder and faster. *It's begun. * \n\nIt was barely dark -- a strange grey-blue twilight in the hardwood forest where she'd collapsed panting after her sprint from the cabin. Her claws tensed, seemingly grasping the earth around her; the seizure rolled into her body like the waves of an ocean she'd never set eyes on, throwing her onto her side, and for a moment she was mindless, the slender head curved so far back along her spine it seemed her neck would break itself. \n\nAnd then the world blinked sideways and she was panting again, in the dirt. \n\nThe petite, dark, red haired girl wiped away the sheen of sweat that covered her face. \n\n\"Disgusting,\" she'd said out loud. The water-leaking-cooling-mechanism that her two-legged-form favored never ceased to make her feel sick to her stomach. She scrubbed her small hands dry in the oak leaves around herself, then stood and felt in the hollow of the tree beside her for her stash. \n\nShe pulled on a pair of Master's old jeans, and one of his v-neck t-shirts. \n\nTonight was the night. \n\nShe had no need of shoes; her human feet had somehow inherited her woods-running calluses.",
        "It was amazing how nice a normal cell seemed next to the shoe. You would think that after his fifth time, Kevin would have been used to solitary confinement, but no it still gave him shivers. \nThe cell looked radically different from when he had left it. All of his posters had been removed, there was a new cell mate on the top bunk. \n\u201c Hi, I'm Matthew! \u201d \n\u201c Go to hell. \u201d Kevin took a seat on his mattress. \nA dark man with a suit and a clipboard appeared at the entrance to the cell. \u201c Mr. Resnick? \u201d \n\u201c Fuckign Christ what? \u201d After weeks without interaction human voices sounded so course. \n\u201c I see. \u201d The man scratched something on his clipboard then took a seat on the chair outside of the cell. \n\u201c My name is Jared Bachman, I am a member of the prison's social services, I'm here to talk to you about suicide prevention. \u201d \nKevin pulled his hands from his face. \u201c Wait what, me? \u201d \n\u201c Our records indicate that you may be facing clinical depression. \u201d The man's voice was nasally whine and he paused between words to suck in breathes of stagnant air. \u201c Ahem.",
        "Everyone was excited. \n\nIt was determination day, the 1 day a year that children at the age of 17 could get tested for their power, or even powers. For some, their abilities had already begun to appear and this was simply a confirmation. For others, the possibilities were endless. Of course, there were the \"common\" powers- super strength, energy beams, flight. According to the pamphlets everyone got, roughly 50 % of people had such powers. There were the less common ones- teleportation, phasing through objects, rapid healing. \n\nAnd of course, there were the rare powers, the ones people both dreamed of having and dreaded. Time travel, telepathy, precognition. Those kinds of powers immediately secured you a job at a research lab or the military. Very high paying jobs, of course. But you got the job whether you wanted it or not. \n\nI'd spent the night before the test staying up, dreaming of that powers I would get. Would I be able to control the weather, like my mom? Or maybe I'd be able to shape-shift, like my brother. He got conscripted by the army after that. Maybe I'd be able to see him if I could do something cool like him. \n\nBut then again, maybe I would get a really dumb power like my English teacher. She could pronounce any word correctly just by reading it. Maybe teaching a language made that a nifty ability, but not one I'd want to have. \n\nWhen the day of the test arrived, I was both groggy and energized from almost no sleep. When they called my group, I was practically sprinting to the door. They changed the test nearly every year, but the basics were always the same. I was ready. \n\nOr so I thought. \n\nWhen we got in the room, there were no chairs or tables or exam papers like I expected. There were shelves filled with tiny bottles. Me and the other 14 kids looked at each other, bewildered. We'd never heard of anyone being tested in this way. \n\"What are those?\" a skinny girl at the back asked. \n\"I dunno,\" someone whispered back. For a long moment, no one moved. You could feel the tension in the air, everyone wondering who would go. \nI shot forward, unable to take the anticipation. Before anyone could react, I sprinted to the shelves. I took one of the fragile bottles in my hands, held it up to the light. On the bottom was a label with a name. \"Alex Jones\". I shrugged, not knowing who that was. \n\n\"They have our names on it,\" I guessed out loud. By then more than half the group had joined me and were busy inspecting the bottles. \n\"Yeah, you're right. This one's mine,\" the skinny girl from earlier announced. After a few minutes of shuffling and swapping, we each had our own bottles. \n\n\"Are we supposed to drink it?\" a tall boy asked, scowling. \"What if it's poisonous?\" \nI stared at him blankly. \"Why would they want to poison us?\" \nHe shrugged. \"The government does all sorts of weird shit.\" \n\nI turned the bottle around in my palm. Other than my name, there were no other markings on its transparent surface. A light blue liquid swished inside of it. \n\nThe skinny girl shrugged and uncapped the bottle. Before we could say anything, she downed every drop.",
        "I'm officially living my worst nightmare; stranded on an island with no sense of direction whatsoever, searching for any source of light or life. The momentum of the waves keeps building and building and I continue to ponder what it takes to survive right as I get sucked into the ocean by a massive wave that hits the shore. I'm struggling to keep myself afloat but all that I hear is the sound of the ocean and even that is slowly fading. My life flashes before me; I see my family and my friends, the good and the bad times like a motion picture, but that suddenly turns dark. And there I lie on the shore with a stopped heartbeat; gone for good. \n\nI just birthed my first child, a beautiful baby girl. You know, I'd been terrified my entire life that I would not be able to host a suitable environment for a baby, but thankfully, I was able to and received this angel. I can't wait to see her grow and mature into this perfect human that I want her to be. Oh what a wonderful day her wedding day will be; she deserves the grandest of weddings, but I will take it one day at a time and cherish each moment I have with her. \n\nBlue and gold. Everyone is draped in the colors that matured us, the colors that made the class of 2019 a class of one, colors that opened our eyes to the endless possibilities. It's a strange combination to feel both ready and nervous for what's to come. We've been sheltered for years now, but it's finally time for us to live up to our potential and change the world in any way that we can. \n\nI was running away, running as fast as I could, but I didn't know what from. Where was I headed? I see lights in different directions and am trying extremely hard to figure out where I am. I'm lost.",
        "Skin-tight black Spandex doesn't really suit me. My ex-husband kept asking me to wear plenty of skin tight clothing but I'm just too round for it to look good. Maybe that's why I found him with that call girl. Of course, the girl hadn't been the one in the gimp suit. \n\nThat doesn't matter really though: I have a new hobby and no need for a hubby. \n\nReally, I blame that awful Penny from number 17 and her showy necklace. It's a hideous thing but she's so stuck up that I had to take it. Luckily for me she really likes to have a few, get the bloody thing out of the safe (showing everyone the safe combination in the process) then make a big play of putting it back. It's a miracle it was still in her possession when I made my move. My heartbeat pounding a thousand beats a minute I'd climbed in via the veranda window, which was never locked, and waltzed to the safe in the loft. Five minutes later I'd walked out up one necklace and down one devious note (signed: Fantastic Mrs Vixen). \n\nThen there had been Susan and her stupid little cameo. Awful bloody thing with an engraved picture of The Queen. That hadn't even been in a safe - I'd just nabbed it when Susan and John had left to go to Waitrose like the pretentious fops that they are. Everyone knows that Tesco is just as good these days but no they had to'buy organic' as if rubbing a turnip in pig shit suddenly made it taste nicer. \n\nOf course, I had a few items taken in a daring heist when I was away on holiday. Nothing I liked though. Fantastic Mrs Vixen only took a few of the gifts that Jonathan had given me when we were courting which had negligible sentimental value. As an added bonus the lovely young police officer had been really unprofessional when he came over to my bungalow. Also when he came over me. He was certainly not going to be suspecting me any time soon. \n\nNow, I'm digging a hole for my pile of minor jewellery (it'll make a nice insurance policy against that heartless bastard stopping his payments) in Dorris' back yard. I've agreed to look after the old woman's garden so it won't be too hard for me to come back for the stash in a while.",

Would you like some syrup for your waffles?, \u201d my mother asks way too bubbly for this time of day. \n\n\u201c Yeah!

Your powers have finally arrived. I told you you'd be a late bloomer! Haha! We ran the genetic testing and it seems like your body was a little overwhelmed\u2026 You have two sequences of powers. We haven't seen this before, and it may be a little unstable, but we're not surprised. With powers being around for the last 200 years, it was bound to be a mutation sooner or later, \u201d the doctor spouted as if it wasn't the best thing since sliced bread. \n\n\u201c I finally have powers?! Can I test them?!, \u201d I asked in a hurry. I was so worried that I would never get them. \n\n\u201c Let's go to the testing room, just in case they're still unstable. Your vitals are fine.",
        "\"I am the Keymaster,\" I yelled, \"Remember that.\" \n\nI was outside the plastic prison for Magneto from XMen. I had just released Magneto. \n\nThe guards all looked at me with hateful eyes. I laughed. \n\n\"Magneto,\" I said, \"Let's get out of here. My car's this one. Yes, the Hyundai bomb.\" \n\nThey were shooting plastic bullets at us from plastic guns. We ran like two cobbers from a mum tassie devil, protecting her litter. Their growl is less than their bite in this case! \n*** \n1 hour beforehand: \n\nI was dressed in a guard's uniform. I'd made it myself. It wouldn't pass close scrutiny, but it was passable in passing display. \n\n\"Hey, pretty girl,\" I said, to the female prison guard, \"Have you done something with your hair.... it looks gorgeous.\" (I knew compliments got you far with women.) \n\n\"Oh, I'm glad you noticed,\" she said, giggling. \n\n\"Damn, I seem to have forgotten my keys,\" I said, \"Can you let me in?\" \n\n\"Ummmm,\" she said, \"Oh damn it, OK.\" \n\nShe opened Magneto's cell. I thought, \"How easy. A little bit of charm gets you a long way, with either women or men, ha, ha, ha!\" \n*** \nAfterwards: \n\n\"Magneto,\" I said, \"We are going to team up and free all the villains super heroes have put away.\" \n\n\"Sounds alright to me,\" said Magneto. \n\nWe ate breakfast at an old cafe. While I had sausages and fried eggs, I smiled. My plan was coming along. To be the Keymaster, the best villain ever.... the one who freed all the other villains, and led the final revolt against, superman, batman, XMen, Captain Courageous and the rest. Yippee. \n*** \nI was getting more powerful, and I suppose my ego was getting bigger too. I'd freed the joker, Magneto, and the Penguin.",

        "The Honorable Judge Gonzalez was tired. It had been a long day, and he wanted nothing else except to go home a crack open a cold one. \n\n\"Alright, last case of the day. Who's next?\" \n\n\"Christopher Atluri stands accused of witchcraft, your honor,\" the court clerk read off her list. \n\nGonzalez raised his eyebrows. \"You're joking.\" \n\n\"I am not joking, your honor. Our state never got around to taking it off the books. Witchcraft is still illegal.\" \n\n\"Well,\" Gonzalez sighed, \"I guess I have no choice then, since my duty is to see that everyone gets a fair trial. Who's the accuser?\" \n\nThe clerk hesitated, then leaned closer to the judge and whispered, \"Old Man Bitters.\" \n\nGonzalez looked at the courtroom for the first time and saw the pasty old man sitting in the audience. He also saw the defendant, a man with a thick black beard, wearing a suit and matching turban. \n\nHe groaned, \"Oh, God *dammit*. I know exactly where this is going.\" \n\nJudge Gonzalez straightened his robe. \"Alright, let's get this over with. I'll have the prosecution's opening statement first.\" \n\nThe lawyer at the table opposite from Atluri stood and monotonously began his opening statement, \"Your honor, Mr. Atluri has been accused of witchcraft on the grounds of-\" \n\nOld Man Bitters jumped up from his seat in the audience and shouted, \"This man and his people are responsible for MILLIONS of American lives lost! He is an *infidel*! A *traitor*! He's-\" \n\n\"For the last time, I'M NOT FUCKING MUSLIM!\" Atluri stood and whipped around to face his accuser. \"I'm Sikh! If you're going to be racist, get it right, you old FUCK!\" \n\nGonzalez pounded his gavel until both men quieted. He jabbed it at them and said, \"I will *not* tolerate that kind of outburst from either of you in my courtroom again, you understand?\" \n\nAtluri bowed his head. \"I apologize, your honor. It's just that he's been harassing me since I moved in next door to him.\" \n\nOld Man Bitters looked like he had bitten into something foul and stayed silent. \n\nJudge Gonzalez leaned back in his chair and said, \"I think I've heard everything I need to hear. Case dismissed\" \n\nLater, as Gonzalez was leaving his office to go home, he found Atluri waiting for him. \n\n\"Oh, hello, Mr. Atluri, was it?\" \n\nThe suited man shook the judge's hand. \"Please, call me Chris. I can't thank you enough for your help back there.\" \n\nGonzalez rubbed the back of his neck. \"Oh, uh, thanks. It's nothing, really. Just doing my job.\" \n\n\"Nah, man, really, I appreciate it. In fact,\" Atluri reached into his jacket pocket, \"Here, have this.\" \n\nHe pulled out a keychain made of an oddly iridescent wood that was carved into a symbol Gonzalez had never seen before. Atluri handed it to the judge. \n\nWhile examining it, Gonzalez said, \"Look, man, I'm thankful for the gift, really, but I don't accept gifts from people who I have tried.\" \n\nHe tried to give the keychain back to Atluri, but the man just closed the judge's hand around it, saying, \"It's for luck. Keep it.\" \n\nThe judge turned it over in his hand. \"I-I can't. Look, if you really want to show your gratitude, buy me a beer or somethi-\" He looked up and the man with the turban was gone. Gonzalez searched the courthouse for him, but to no avail. \"Well, I guess I can keep it,\" he said to himself. \n\nAs Gonzalez was driving home, hitting every green light on the way, he got a sudden urge to buy a lottery ticket. The man had never played the lottery before, regarding it as insurance for suckers, but tonight he stopped at a gas station bought a dollar scratcher for the first time.",

        "Turbulence buffeted the ship as we dove through the clouds, our flaming engines leaving a trail of smoke a mile long. Still, the Federation ships pursued us relentlessly. \n\nI glanced at my copilot, his blue skin glistening with sweat as he attempted to keep the ship from falling apart. \n\n\"You're doing a good job Zefra,\" I said, desperately hoping it was true. \n\nAnother round of laser bolts slammed into the ship. Bloody hell, couldn't they see we where already doomed? Rhetorical question.... they really didn't care; the ruthless bastards. \n\nThe ground was coming into view now. I could see the towering mountains to the west, looming up like giant waves, ready to crush as at the slightest mistake. \n\nI stomped hard on the thruster pedal and the ship began to turn ever so slowly. Normally it would have been much faster, but those Federation dogs had left my ship in tatters. It was incredible we hadn't blown apart on re-entry. \n\nI can make out individual trees now. All I can do is aim for the largest open space and hope we don't die. \n\n\"Zefra,\" I barked, \"on my command I want you to cut the engines and eject the cargo pod.\" \n\nHe nodded in reply. Doesn't really say much, but that's probably because he doesn't have a mouth. \n\nThe ground is closer now and I've spotted my target for landing. \n\n\"Now Zefra!\" \n\nI could feel what little thrust the engines were still giving, cut out as he stabbed at the controls. \n\nWithout the rumbling of our fusion drive, it was deathly silent. Until the next round of laser bolts slammed into the hull. That was a real bad round, I could feel it. Sure enough, the thruster controls started blinking red, signifying that they would be as much help as my ex-wife raising our children (not that I'm still bitter about that). \n\nThen the moment was upon us. The ground sped towards us eagerly, and I pulled out my last ace, deploying the speed breaks. \n\nThey worked! Momentarily. Then they snapped clean off, spiraling away behind us. \n\nIt was too late to do anything but hold on now. \n\nWe smashed into the ground still going far too fast, slid across an open field and through a thicket of trees. It hurt, I'm not going to lie. \n\nAs we emerged from the thicket of trees, still out of control, I saw a herd of black and white cows fleeing through the paddock before us. \n\nThey were never going to be fast enough as we quickly overtook them, sending bovines flying through the air.",
        "Like a sacrificial lamb, the child was carefully loaded into the spacecraft. \n\nHe was to be a test subject, the guniea pig for a whole world, the frontrunner to a *new* world. If he could survive, then others could to. \n\n(If he couldn't, then.... humanity would only lose one.) \n\nThe baby was chosen from a pool of the many unwanted children in the world; after a rigorous selection process, he was determined to be the best. \n\nHis parents had not given him a name, so the world chose one together. \n\nHis name was Adam, and he would travel upon the *Eden. * \n\n******** \n\n*Year 8, Day 54* \n\nAdam tapped the screen, watching the animation of the portable water purifier to review. \n\n\"Aaiee, do I have to take the quiz today?\" he moaned.

        "Mary knocked and took a step back, looking down towards her shoes. Chris kept his eyes trained on the wavy oval of glass inset on the center of the door. A figure approached from the interior and the door swung inwards. Scents of pine and cinnamon wafted out, Mary's head snapped up, a smile spread across her face showing teeth. \n\n\u201c Chris! Mary! Welcome, come in, come in. \u201d They were waved inside. Mary took the time to carefully wipe her boots before stepping across the threshold. Chris simply stepped forward and in, making room for Mary to follow. They both began the process of removing their thick outerwear. Unwinding scarves, pulling off mittens and shoving them into pockets before reaching with numb fingers towards zipper pulls. \n\n\u201c It's freezing out there tonight! \u201d Chris stated gaily. No one argued. Mary, stocking-footed, padded her way towards the open kitchen with her grocery bag of tupperwares slung over her shoulder. She'd spent the morning carefully portioning out each tupperware with items to make a salad now that she was here. Chris didn't like his food to touch, so they were contributing a salad bar to the night's potluck offerings. \n\nThe kitchen was crowded, as ten or more people stood gathered near the center island. They circled, like birds, picking at various dishes and ignoring others. Mary found an opening on the long side of the island, closest to the sink, and quickly stepped up between two backs. Both people glanced over their shoulders and, noticing her pulling tupperwares out of her bag, took a step forward to give her more space. She began lining up her squares in two neat rows. \n\n\u201c What's that you've got there? \u201d a friendly voice directed her way. Mary glanced up, the corner of her mouth quirking almost towards a smile, as she finished setting out the last tupperware. \n\n\u201c Oh, we've brought along a salad bar! \u201d Chris said, appearing at Mary's side. \u201c It was her idea. So no one has to have anything they don't like in their salad. Always considerate of everyone, my Mary. \u201d Chris beamed at the other guest, his hand on Mary's low back. Mary smiled up at Chris. \n\n\u201c What a fun thought.",
        "Exhausted, Pyral fell to his knees. \n\nBeeathing raggedly, he tried to pierce the fog clouding his mind, he tried to remember why he was here. A great feeling of urgency crouched at the back of his mind. There was a reason, he knew, for that urgency. A reason that eluded him the more he tried to focus on it. But his brain was too slow, his body hurt too much and he was far too tired. \n\nGasping in pain, he rolled onto his back. \n\nDimly, he was aware that he hit his head on the stone path. Images flashed before his closed eyes, leaving behind impressions. Desperately, he tried to capture an image. Tried to hold on to one. Any of them could be the key he needed. Any of them could be what he needed to answer the only thing that mattered. \n\nWhat the hell was he doing here? \n\nSoon, that question was the only thing that pounded through his mind with every heartbeat. He couldn't even think to ask himself his own name, nevermind remember it. He had no idea how long he focused on that one thought, holding on to the only thing that kept him from giving way to his pain, his exhaustion. All notion of time faded away. \n\nSlowly, he noticed his breathing evened out. Clutching at the one thing that could help him escape, he concentrated on his breathing. The question began to slowly dissolve in his mind, giving way to all the aches in his body. He had to take it slowly, one step at a time. Taking a deep breath, he opened his eyes. \n\nAbove him, clouds floated calmly against the blue sky. The sunlight was burning his eyes, but he forced himself to endure it. Lying there, staring at the sky, the feeling of urgency seemed to grow. It threatened to engulf his mind, to drag him back once again to a state of utter uselesness. \n\nNo, he couldn't let that happen. \n\nStruggling in himself, he quelled the feeling. He didn't know how long he had lain there, doing absolutely nothing. He did know that it had been too long. Ignoring every instinct in his body, he turned his head. \n\nTall grass sprouted by the stone path, rippling gently in the light breeze. He marvelled at each individul stalk, perfectly synchronised with all the others yet in its own way an individual. He couldn't tell one apart from another. \n\nPyral frowned. Why was that important? Why was he thinking about individuals and groups? Somehow, he knew that his feeling of urgency was related to that but as elusive as an eel the connection flew around the back of his mind. \n\nAs he was concentrating, he barely noticed the bird land in front. It was a pretty non-descript bird. It was small, orange-beaked with a white and grey plumage. Standing there, it eyed him curiously. \n\nIn an instant he remembered. Eyes wide with fear, he struggled back to his knees. \n\nSuppressing the pain that lanced up his side, he found his staff at arm's reach. One end was vaguely shaped like a claw, the other was metal-tipped for fighting. Sticking the metal end in between the stones of the path, he clambered laboriously to his feet. \n\nDizzy with pain, he practically fell on to his staff. His legs were so weak it was a wonder they could even hold themselves connected to his body. Trying not to fall over, he vaguely noticed the bird had flew away. \n\nThe view was decidedly beautiful but the same in all direction.",
        "\"Not again,\" my coworker said. \"You know one of these days the player is going to arrive before you.\" \n\n\"I know, I know. I'm really sorry I arrived late again.\" I said like it was the first time even though it was probably the hundredth time. \"It's just that you know that I don't really like this job.\" \n\n\"You always say that, yet you haven't looked for a solution.\" she said. \"Besides this job is not that bad. We have our own property, we don't have to mine the gold for coins, we trade for it. There is no chance of the player or another NPC killing us.\" \n\n\"Yes and that's the problem. We always follow the same routine, even if there is no player at the time. It's really boring being the standard invulnerable shopkeepers. Also you know that we are not invulnerable, it's just that the players here aren't allowed to attack us,\" I answered quickly. To be honest I had been thinking about this for a while. Life like this tends to be boring, especially with only one player going around at the moment. I wish we weren't allocated to a single-player zone. My cousins in the MMORPG zone have it better than me, even though they can sometimes be robbed and mugged. But what's life without some risk? I want to find out. \n\n\"So what's your solution? You do have the experience to move on to another genre. Maybe you can't get a fancy job as an A.I. bot with respawn privileges but I bet you could become minion if you really want that risky life or maybe be part of a tutoria-\" \n\n\"No, I want more,\" I interrupted her. \"I want to be like the players, who roam around and can have any adventure they want!\" \n\n\"Hahaha you know that's impossible. Players are born and picked because of their unique qualities. Even if you had those qualities, you wouldn't know it because they don't tell the people what are those qualities that make you apt to be a player. If somebody else heard what you said, they would probably think that you are a villain in the making,\" she said somewhat worried. \n\n\"Trust me, I don't want to be a villain or a hero for that matter. I just want to be a player so I can go out wherever I want and whenever I want. It's not about the risks and rewards of that live, it's about being able to make your own choic-\" \n\nSadly I never finished that sentence since I heard the doorbell ring. Suddenly we went quiet, like our job said we should do and started to recite the same lines we had been saying for the past years every time a player went into our store. As usual the player grunted, dropped a lot of stuff to sell and we traded it for the established amount of money. \n\nThe worst part of it was that the player used to be my friend. We played around as kids until suddenly he was picked to be a player.",
        "Whispered secrets sat bottled on the desk, captured after being found floating around aimlessly upon their owners' deaths with none to repeat them. They held down curling yellowed parchment covered with scraps of lists and facts unable to be recovered by living minds, birthdays and last names and favored alcohols and directions and instructions on how to perform live-saving procedures at the crucial moment. It would have taken an eternity to sort through all of them, though the figure who flipped through one stack knew well enough where each could be found. \n\nThe figure was a thoroughly average sort of humanoid entity, likely a human, the composite of every loved one's face after death or distance took them, those scents which faded first from clothing and pillows and then from the mind altogether until all that remained was a memory of having the memory. They perfectly hummed the tune and lyrics from every song stumbled on in performance as they pulled out the note they wanted. There was a momentary nostalgia at the way dust motes swirled in the light as they held up the receipt-sized paper; perhaps a singular childhood image of holding up a receipt of that exact size in that exact lighting, complete with the logo of a store long since closed down printed on the back. \"Here you go,\" they rasped when they passed the memory back to the one who had forgotten it. \n\n*'The name and face of my attacker.'* \n\nTwelve letters altogether, and a hasty sketch not even worth the canvas of their body.",
        "Emily, my dearest. \n\nI am enamoured with you, and when I spend time with you, I feel so happy and relaxed! I constantly check your many social media profiles, not just to gaze upon your beautiful face, but to see what new adventure you have undertaken. \n\nI know we have only known each other for a few years, and I wanted to ask you so many times.... so often I would be waiting for you, but alas, you always had another man by your side. My pain grew inside me, I knew you were the one, but I couldn't bring myself to ask. I should have asked, but that was so long ago. \n\nLast year, when you approached me, eyes gleaming with excitement. Your mouth was trembling slightly and I never had seen you more happy than this. I was so excited, hoping that you at last would fall for me, that I would be your man. But as I steadied your trembling hands, calming you down, I whispered into your ear, \"its OK, everything will be fine Emily\". Then, I felt a cold metallic object between my fingers. What I saw next devastated me. The engagement ring Tim had bought you. \n\nI am sad to say, I was not pleased for you at that moment, jealousy stole my heart for you. And I regret much, not attending the wedding, ignoring multiple text messages, distancing myself from you.... I still would check social media, just to make sure you hadn't changed your mind. But.... I doubted even continuing to try. \n\nI lost track of time, I met a new girl, Sarah, with time I forgot about you. I would drink myself to sleep, crying into my pillow as I watched you grow. Each day you got older and older, and I was without you. Buy Sarah helped me forget. We had such a good time together, Sarah and I would attend musicals, bowl, watch movies, and eventually, I forgot about you. \n\nThen I found Sarah, cheating on me in my own bed. I began to resent her, and in turn, resented myself for trusting anyone but you. I needed to see you, to see your smile, to see your life.",
        "She was ticked off, again. They knew it was a problem with her. She couldn't help it. She'd been raised to finish what she started. But they constantly scheduled her for just start of these long flights. But she had an ace in the hole, this time. She'd gotten her certifications, and she was commander on all her flights from now on. \nWhenever she had two more takeoffs than landings, she began to feel anxiety. The feeling that she wasn't coming back this time because she'd left something undone. Like forgetting to put up the landing gear, or raise the flaps after takeoff. Well, if she had taken off but hadn't landed the damn plane at all, she had left something undone. Naturally that causes anxiety. \nBut as commander, she could take the yoke herself, anytime she wanted. Just to be sure, she told herself, she would make a point of landing 20 of 30 more times in the next year than she took off.",
        "It was a long tiring day as usual. I leaned on my sofa throwing my bag on to the near by table. Slowly dozed off to sleep. My imaginations rushed in, I could literally feel my dream and it was of none other than an episode which caught my attention today. Me and one of my colleague were having lunch and a small boy standing outside the canteen was cleaning the window panes, he was hardly 10. Full greased head to foot, filthy clothes, torn shoes but with a cherry red lips and a droopy eyes filled with all innocence he could gather within it. \nIt was raining and he was shivering after a while. He sat loopy near the window base facing me. I was having coffee then. As we started staring at each other I felt difficulty in drinking my coffee. It was nothing but me sitting comfortably inside the cafe warm and the boy now half drenched killed me within. I couldn't read any thing from his face that he is not liking what he is going through. I called him and offered him a tea. Gladly he accepted it! I asked dont you feel cold, he told no I feel close to nature. I was so taken by the love and spirit he had within and his love for nature, the smallest things which I couldn't realize which he made me feel was aw inspiring. I wish I had a mouse with me to take of the poverty in his life with a click, and fill his childhood with all the beautiful things he deserve.",
        "Everybody loves Kazaam. Or at least, now they do. \n\nWhen Kazaam first appeared on the streets, he was known only as Chris Smalls, and he didn't have a very pristine reputation. The guy could teleport anywhere he wanted to at will, so of course he was teleporting into places where he didn't exactly belong. VIP clubs, secure areas, ladies locker rooms- you name it, and Chris at some point or another got into it. Eventually, the law caught up with him, and an arrest at all costs was put out through the system. Wanted \"Dead or Alive\" joked all the newspapers. It seemed like young Chris was heading nowhere, or rather, everywhere, in a hurry. \n\nBut one day, the cops came forward with a deal. They had a hostage situation, and they could use his help; get the innocent people out of there, and his crimes would be forgiven. Chris jumped on the offer, and sure enough was able to teleport into the bank and save those people. With Chris' helping hand, they were even able to catch the crook himself, who happened to be none other than a nefarious serial robber with a hefty bounty. Chris suddenly had a clean record, and a pocketful of cash. It was then that he realized that he could probably really help the people around him, while earning a comfortable living on the side. \n\nIt took some time for the public to change their opinion of him, but soon he became everyone's favorite local hero. His face became a common sight on the evening news, and his new name,'Kazaam', a frequent subject in the paper. And this time, it was for all of the good reasons. Ironically enough, he was now getting into all the sorts of places he wanted to before, except with open doors and arms. Kazaam had a good life going for him, and it seemed like there was nothing that could stop his zero to hero story. \n\nYou can imagine Hank's surprise when he looked up late one Wednesday night to see a disheveled and slightly drunk Kazaam stumble into his bar. \n\nKazaam shuffled over to the bar counter, eased himself onto one of the stools and laid his forehead against the cool wood. Hank couldn't hear exactly what he started mumbling about, but he heard'scotch' and'rocks' somewhere in there so he poured out a glass and placed it next to Kazaam's head. \n\n\"On the house. You earned it, Kazaam.\" \n\nKazaam raised his head, stared at the glass for a moment and then downed it. He smacked his lips, rubbed the back of his sleeve against his lips and then buried his face in his hands. \n\n\"Thanks,\" muttered Kazaam. \"But tonight, I am Chris. And I'm paying for that drink.\" \n\nHank shrugged and took Chris' glass. \"Sure thing, Chris. Whatever you want. Anything else I can get you? Anything I can help with? You seem a little.... down.\" \n\nChris lowered his hands and propped his elbows on the counter. He gave Hank a bewildered look, as if he didn't really understand what he just said. \"You mean.... you actually care? I mean, you care if I'm, you know, feeling down?\"",
        "When they were found, the world rejoiced. It was confirmed - we are not alone in the universe. But what would come next, nobody could have predicted. Ten weeks after the frozen eggs were extracted from a drifting asteroid in the Kuiper Belt, they hatched, in a lab controlled environment. They were relatively harmless in birth - tiny and fragile, with dull claws and strange oval shaped heads. Scientists allowed them to grow to maturity under close observation, isolated in a chamber. Our cameras recorded them twenty four seven. The first casualty came about three months after their birth, when the largest of the creatures somehow escaped the chamber. It left only a large hole where the wall had been, and went on a rampage within the facility. Dr Jonas Ruthger, the mans name was. Impaled by its sharp claws and torn to pieces, the man stood no chance. The response task force that entered the facility to contain the incident quickly found out that the creatures have the ability to manipulate magnetic fields, not unlike telekinesis. As they rained bullets on the large predator, it simply conjured an invisible wall, shielding itself. It took two hours before they restrained it using a grenade to knock it out - gas and bullets proved useless. \n\nA few months more and they had seemingly matured. The largest predator, dubbed Apex, had begun displaying signs of leadership and extremely high intelligence. The creatures seemed to realize they were under observation, and at that point, it took them only thirty minutes to find and destroy every single camera. Being in the dark, we immediately readied the response task force once more, armored to the teeth - but as they prepared to enter the chamber, the power grid went down, darkening the whole facility.",
        "It started as a normal day at the bank. I was dropping off a check from my accounting job and I was in line behind a big guy who I'd struck up a conversation about the wildly fluctuating weather with. I'd just mentioned the crazy wind and how things had taken a turn for the worse when a couple people in balaclavas and big winter coats came in. \"See, case in point. In a couple days, they'll be putting those away and wearing t-shirts again.\" \n\nIn terms of last words before the shit hit the fan, those are pretty stupid-sounding. \n\nThe guns came out then, shiny metal with murderous intent. Suddenly I felt naked and afraid. Right after that, I realized I probably wasn't going to get to the library for a while. My mind handles crises in strange ways, apparently. \n\nThey overpowered the old portly security guard in moments as I stood and watched in shock. Unfortunately, the guard seemed to be years past the time when he was in good enough condition to provide security. So that left the rest of us. The big guy I was talking to had ducked behind a desk. The drive through teller still didn't know what was going on but the other tellers had dropped down below their desks and the other customers were shrinking away from the sudden outbreak of violence. \n\nDamn. That made me the closest person to them, and probably the next one they would approach. Fortunately for me, ever since elementary school, I had a way of dealing with people who seemed likely to hurt me. I stared at up into one corner of the ceiling and nudged my awareness into my nose, willing the blood vessels to open. I felt the pressure build in my nose and then release. \n\nI cringed, collapsed to the ground, holding my head in both hands. \"Damn tumor,\" I stage-grumbled. \"Sorry, give me a minute,\" I said, taking one hand off my head and holding the palm towards them, fingers up. The other hand slid around from the side of my head to my forehead. I appeared to struggle through a spike of pain before regaining composure, and I felt the warm damp stickiness of blood tracing down my lip, the coppery taste as it ran into my mouth. \"Right. I guess I'm...\" I winced again. \"I'll talk. I don't have all that long to live anyway.\" \n\nThe bank robbers, because that's what my brain realized they were, seemed to soften slightly. \"Hey, no worries, man, we just want the money. Don't get me wrong, we will totally kill anybody that tries anything, but we don't wan na have to kill anybody,\" one of them said. \n\n\"Thanks,\" I said weakly. \"Just take the money and don't shoot anybody.\" I hoped that had given the top bank person enough time to get the police involved and get done. \n\nAfter a few minutes of the robbers moving things around, I saw the police cars with the lights on coming up the street. I waved the rest of the people in the building to get out. They bolted and I stayed. It wouldn't have been consistent with the character I'd developed.",
        "Full lips, blue eyes, black hair. His quintessential woman. \n\nShe glanced to her side, probably feeling the piercing stare of his eyes on her face. He whipped his face forwards, watching her actions through the corner of his eyes. She wouldn't stop looking at him and in a burst of awkward embarassment, he looked out the window instead. He began to curse himself and his hopeless ineptitude. \"Fuckin' *Idiot* you are, mate. Just talk to her, just give it a shot. A pretty lass like that's once in a lifetime\" \n\nHe heard a shuffling sound next to him and looked around to see the voluptuous figure of the Woman settle into the seat next to him. Her beauty assaulted his eyes with all the subtlety of a heavy, red brick. \n\n\"Hi, I'm Anna\" \n\n\"Jim\" \n\n\"So tell me, Jim. Who are you?\" \n\n\"Pretty much nobody. I'm not anyone important\" \n\nThe bus stopped. An old couple sauntered to their seats. Jim took a deep breath. The silence started to weigh on him. \n\n\"So this is awkward\" \n\n\"No, it's not. Silence isn't awkward. It's people who are, silence is golden, silence is bliss. Come on then tell me more. What do you do?\" \n\n*As Jim relayed the details of his relatively mundane existence, she fell deeper and deeper into the chasm of her love for him. His messy hair, his nonchalance and disregard for her attention was curiously attractive.",
        "My alarm buzzed and I groaned. I knew exactly where the button was so I made an effort to slap the snooze and stretch my arm at the same time. I missed. The alarm clattered to the floor and switched to FM. Now I had extremely loud Spanish radio playing **and** I had to get up now instead of sleeping another ten minutes. I wiped drool from my mouth before slowly opening my eyes. \n\nYou know that feeling when you accidentally poop yourself? Like when you wake up and there's a giant floating head staring at you? What? You've never experienced that? Okay well that is what happened. \n\nThe giant head sniffed the air, \u201c Oh my god did you really just shit yourself?! AHAHA! \u201d \n\nSo another question. Do you know that feeling when the giant head that caused you to crap yourself makes you feel bad about it? I'm going to assuming your answer was yes. \n\nI opened my mouth to let him know what was what, \u201c WHAAGGHFUCK. \u201d \n\nIf a head could double over in laughter, this thing was doing it. \n\n\u201c Oh man, this is great. \u201d \n\nI sat up and shuffled to the bathroom, holding my backside. The head continued roaring in laughter at me. I cleaned up best that I could and wrapped a towel around me. The head was floating around looking at my T.V. and stuff. It shifted its focus back onto me. \n\n\u201c I didn't realize the human race was so inferior that they actually based their lives around technology! I mean look at this thing. What are you suppose to do with this? Stare at it? \u201d He floated over to my alarm that was still going off. \u201c And this thing is very loud and annoying. \u201d Lasers shot out of his eyes leaving a burnt charred spot on the ground. \n\n\u201c Look mister.... uhm.... Head. I'm not sure what you are or what you're doing here- \u201d \n\n\u201c That is Captain Head to you. I am on an important mission to determine the human race's progress and see if they are ready to join the galactic unity. \u201d He drifted much closer to me than I wanted him to. \u201c So far I am less than impressed. \u201d \n\nOkay. I had an alien in my room and the fate of humanity rested on my shoulders. Mother always told me I would screw up big one day. Captain Head lifted my phone up with kinesis and began to thumb through it.... without thumbs. \n\n\u201c This is an interesting device though. Apps huh? Reddit, Grindr... OH now this is an impressive app. Facebook! That sounds right up my alley. \u201d \n\nThe giant head spent the next few hours laughing and posting on my facebook profile. \n\n\u201c Look, Captain Head. Didn't you have an important mission? \u201d \n\n\u201c Not now! Someone is wrong on the internet!",

        "We cowered together under the staircase, the wind howling around the old wooden house. The loose panels which formed the wall rattled, and I shivered a little as another gust blasted through the many gaps in the collapsing structure. \n\nDespite the wind, we heard the gunshots. A harvesting gang had been seen roaming nearby, and now they had come here. They would take people captive, and sell them on as easy kills to the highest bidder. Usually they took food as payment - the most valuable of resources. Of course they needed weapons and ammunition too, but they would only kill for themselves when the victim was too strong or too difficult to transport. The townships who were prepared to buy wasteland captives were few and far between, so it was common for the gangs to kill adults themselves, and capture children. \n\nWhy, you may ask? Why would anyone pay to kill another? Well, from birth you can survive exactly thirty years. For many, the peoples of the wasteland for example, this was enough. But for the powerful, the men and women who led farms, they wanted to hold that power. And so, they paid their way to immorality. \n\nAnother gunshot. Closer this time. A scream pierced the night. I could not tell who it was, but it must have been one of our neighbours, a friend. A kin. \n\nMy brother sat in front of me, eyes screwed shut, hands buried in his matted black hair. The day had been wonderful. We had sat in the sun, splashing our feet in the river to stay cool. Despite it's misleading name, the \"wasteland\" is a beautiful place. Now that was almost forgotten, as we sat together in the dark empty house. I leant forward and took his hand. He opened his eyes, and seemed to snap out of his panic as he focused on me. \n\n\"Not quite how we expected to spend our last evening, eh sis?\" he whispered. He always had had a dark sense of humour. \n\n\"No, not exactly\" I agreed, smiling weakly. \n\n\"Although at least we're together\" he said, giving my hand a reassuring squeeze. \n\n\"Didn't I tell you I'd never leave you?\" I said, squeezing back. \n\n\"You know you might not be able to keep that promise for much longer don't you\". He looked down, avoiding my gaze. \"Mum would never say which of us was born first. Only that it was 8 hours apart\" \n\nFor the next minute there was silence between us. I knew, we both knew, that those 8 hours would be unbearable. We were roused from our thoughts by the sound of an engine starting, roaring over the storm.The harvesters were leaving. We listened intently as the sound of the vehicle faded into the distance. \n\nThim smiled. \"Well sis, at least we can stretch our legs for ten minutes now. It's almost midnight\". His face dropped a little as he mentioned the time when one of us had been born. But he quickly recovered for my sake. \"It's almost midnight so the stars will be out\" \n\nHe scrambled out the cupboard we had sheltered in and went to the window. I followed, and stood behind him as we gazed out at the stars, as we so often did. I stood there with him for what felt like a lifetime. But I knew the time was approaching.",
        "\"Dad, you're on TV again!\" I heard Eric's voice from the living room. I tried to stay away from the TV as much as I could; I always felt vaguely uneasy watching it. And I had *certainly* never seen myself on it! Had I? \n\nMy memory wasn't what it had been before the Great War, a fact my doctor blamed on the residual toxins in the air from all the bombs. I hadn't actually served on the front lines, I remember now. I had some hazy memories of six years spent at the base, helping to train the real soldiers and spending long hours on guard duty. \n\nI itched absently at my left leg. It always began to hurt whenever I thought too much about the Great War, one of the many reasons I rarely did. As I did every time I itched it, I felt a strange feeling that it wasn't exactly a part of my body, that it didn't belong there. But I had talked to my doctor about it, in one of my bi-monthly meetings with him, and he told me not to worry. \n\nAnd so I didn't worry. I stopped itching my leg, and stopped fighting the near-overpowering impulse to *STOP THINKING ABOUT THE WAR*. \n\n\"Dad, you never told me you won a medal!\" Eric called again, and I smiled faintly.",
        "The planet practically rung from the announcement, broadcast as it was from every speaker on earth simultaneously -- and scientists would later confirm that it was absolutely simultaneous, no light speed delays could be measured. Even unplugged speakers issued the proclamation, somehow being audible despite the lack of power. \n\nThe first question on everyone's minds was \"Who could have sent the message?\" The second was \"What's Galactic Deathball?\" \n\nSlowly, over the next few months, wars between nations ground to a halt, generations-longs conflicts were quietly resolved, and even the most isolationist governments attended meetings with other world leaders. The question on everyone's minds: How do we prepare for something when we have no idea when it will come or what it is. \n\nThe long-term changes weren't immediately apparent to the common man not privy to the secret backroom discussions, though everyone knew something was going on when the Olympics was abruptly altered, it's events taking on a more.... martial bent. Governments started sponsoring training facilities, focusing on multi-discipline events, such as triathlons, and ski-and-shoot, and even new combination sports such as the MMArathon. It became obvious to anyone paying attention that the world was training \"peak human\" superheros to compete in the Galactic Deathball, and the contenders were rewarded handsomely. \n\nYears passed without incidence, and slowly the unity caused by the message was ground away by the remorseless passage of time. The new sports lost their initial vigor, and in many countries, their sponsorship. But they were popular enough in their own niche that there was still a significant community of practitioners. \n\nAnd the the second message, as it was called, occurred. A copy of The Rulebook appeared next to every person on the planet, though this time staggered to appear as they slept. The book was written in two languages, one unknown and eye-searingly alien, the other in the mother tongue of the recipient. One upside was that we were handed the greatest rosetta stone ever made, and the alien language was deciphered almost as fast as it took to upload the scans to the internet. \n\nThe Rulebook is actually somewhat of a misnomer, most of the text was the history of the games, descriptions of previous events, and the sort of background information you would expect from a scholarly work rather than a purely technical document explaining the game. But that might have been because the game was absurdly simple. \n\nFirst, the field: An equilateral multi-sided polygon with a minimum of 4 sides a minimum of roughly 1/4 mile across and a maximum of a little under 1/2 mile across. The number of sides is twice the number of teams participating. \n\nEach team starts at a face of the polygon arrayed as they choose, and teams draw lots to determine the order that they chose which face where they start. The titular Deathball, a 1/4 kilo lump of iron with handholds designed to be easily grasped by all participating species, starts in the exact center of the field. \n\nAt the signal, everyone has 5 seconds to get onto the field. If you leave the field without carrying the deathball, you die. If you leave the field carrying the deathball, you choose who dies and the field reset.",
        "\"You're telling me your people crucified and tortured the Messiah we sent you before he even turned 35?!!\" exclaimed the Holy Pontiff sitting above me in the hearing chamber. \n\n\"Well.... the thing is...\" I was scrambling to come up with a sufficient excuse for humanity's violence problem. We were already regarded as the drunken inbred neighbors of the galaxy. \n\n\"That's got to be a record! I don't think a single species in the entire galaxy has found and killed a Messiah so brutally in so little time. In fact, I think this even beats the Volrogs record of having theirs burned at the stake,\" exclaimed the over-tentacled alien. \n\n\"Um, what?\" I mumbled. I don't know why humanity always elects it's least competent people to lead them. \n\n\"I think humanity is going to do just fine in the galaxy. Case dismissed.\" \n\n\n*Aside: This is my first submission here.",
        "A girl with long honey blonde hair knocked lightly on the door of the bright Victorian style house. Her legs shifting back and forth in a bowlegged pattern. She looked up at the expanse of the house. *She really wants to dispel the whole witch rumors huh? Oh.... She has to help me.... She just has to. * The door opened a crack. \n\n\"Business or pleasure?\" Whispered a soft sultry voice on the other side of the door. A flash of raven confirmed it was her. \n\n\"B-Business.\" She cast her eyes down to the floor and fidgeted. The voice gave a derisive snort. \n\n\"Very well...\" The door opened a smidge more and she was quickly pulled inside. \"Well dear sister.... What brings you here? Something the matter? You never have asked for me to use any of my powers.\" The girl looked at the long black haired woman that supposedly was her sister. \n\n\"W-Well..\" The woman ushered her to sit down. \n\n\"Come dear Camille. There's no need to be shy.\" The woman cast a quick glance on Camille's odd limping gait and hide a crooked smile behind her lace fan. \"Now what is the matter dear?\" Camille took a deep breath. \n\n\"It's Wallace...\" She paused. \"You know? The man that I've been seeing lately.\" \n\nThe woman gave a twitch of a grin. \"Oh yes I seem to remember him...\" She fanned herself profusely. \"What's the matter with Wallace?\" \n\nCamille flushed red. \"It's rather embarrassing but I didn't know who else to turn to dear sister.\" She took a deep breath and whispered. \"Wh-When we make love, h-his manhood seems to triple in size. Making it hurt and n-near impossible. And whenever I ask him about it he avoids the question and refuses to get help.\" \n\n\"Well I can't help him if he doesn't want help darling.\" \n\nCamille nodded. \"I know.... So I want you to change *me*\" \n\nThe woman's eyes widened in shock. \"Change *you*?\"",
        "\"I haven't been completely honest with you,\" he said. \n\nOutside the office, the night sky was made darker with the constant drops of rain. The trees swayed in an uncontrollable tremollo of wind, as if they wanted to escape the roots that have kept them alive for so long. \n\nArms wrapped around herself, she braced against the weather, all the while listening to his voice. \n\nShe had never heard him this way before. He had always been loud. Confident. Not the quiet and solemn type she currently beheld. \n\n\"The last few months have been great,\" he continued without waiting for any cue or even an assurance that she had heard him. \"But, I need to tell you. I just broke up Zoe. For good.\" \n\nDean fidgeted in his seat then, painfully aware of the underwear bunching up in his asshole. He was afraid of what he needed to say next. Being alone with her now though, he knew that he needed to say it. \n\n\"I'm so sorry V. I didn't lie about before though. We did break up last November. Some months after that, we decided to try again. And we've been together ever since.\" \n\nV followed the lightning streaking across the sky. She closed her eyes then and counted inward, *1... 2... 3..* Thunder roared. *We are right under the storm, * she thought. She began focusing on her breathing while Dean continued. \n\n\"Until last week,\" Dean said. \"When we got back from the beach, I had to end it.\" \n\n\"Why?\" V asked, her shaky voice betraying her calm stature. \n\nDean considered the question, struggling to find the right words. \"I found my happiness somewhere else.\" \n\nAfter a moment of shared silence, Dean turned away and walked to the window. Sighing, he continued, \"I didn't tell you this to force you into action. I'm not trying to make you like me. You may not even like me. You're just too nice sometimes.\" \n\nHis chuckle quickly evaporated in the solemnity of the moment. \n\n\"I'm sorry. I know you could hate me for what I did. And maybe you should. But.... I just couldn't take all the lies anymore. \n\n\"I'm the last person to speak about truths, but the only thing I truly know is that whatever we are, I just want to share the truth with you. Even if we continue as friends, become something more - fingers crossed haha -, or even nothing at all. I just..... wanted you to know. The truth.\" \n\nThe words pierced her, unleashing a heavy chest characterized with *that* feeling. She had been hurt, but in her 27 years, she knew that it is only the ones that were able to get close that are able to hurt us so. \n\nV opened her eyes then, finding Dean's outline looking out the window. She was thankful that he was looking away from her. For a while, she was content to look at him. \n\nAnd against her conscience, against the heavy pain in her heart, and against all thoughts of reason she said, \"Hey.\" \n\nHe stiffened at the words and turned around and met her eyes.",
        "\"We have a surprise for you, Edgar.\" \n\nThe nurse came into my room with a smile. I fucking hate surprises, but I couldn't tell her that. She had been my nurse for several months now, and she was a pleasant older woman. She cared a lot for her charges. At least, she seemed to. \n\n\"What is it?\" I asked, feigning interest. The grin went from a subtle smile to a face splitting gash. She was very excited. That meant I was better, but no, the doctor would be the one to tell me that. That leaves a person. \n\n\"You have a visitor! I'll bring him in right away.\" She walked out of the room in a joyful gait, leaving me unmoved. I hurt today, I really don't want a visitor unless it's family. But no one really cares when they are doing their philanthropic part.",
        "The fall leaves rustled in the wind through the crowd of children. One stray leaf found itself separated form the rest as it rose into the sky, only to land on the top of a monkey bar. As it lay there a great hand came swooping from below, forcing the lone leaf to curl around the bar. As the child let the other monkey bar go he fell flat to his bum. The leave proved to slippery of a surface for him to continue his long trek across the bars. \n\nThe child began to cry and the lone leaf could not help but feel responsible. Of course it wasn't the leaf's fault, it can not control the whims of the wind. The leaf, still stuck in the child's hands, could feel the child's pain through his tight grip. Angry at the leaf the child throws the leaf to the ground and continues his plea for help. Finally one of the teachers rushes over, stomping on the leaf in her wake, over the child. The man picked up the child and began to carry him to the nurse, leaving the leaf alone on the playground. The leaf tried ever so hard to follow the teacher and child, but was swooped away by the wind. \n\nThe leaf was then circling the playground, confused as to why the wind was choosing the playground as it's focal point. But the leaf is not aware of the wind's motives, simply of it's actions. Soon enough the leaf found itself rushed to the ground just in front of a small girl. The girl ran right at the leaf, suddenly falling. Again the leaf proved to be a rather slippery surface, this time for a shoe rather than a hand though. Suddenly the leaf felt the same sense of guilt as it had before. \n\nThe girl, much like the boy, began to cry. She paid much less attention to the leaf however, focusing solely on her pain. It seems that teachers care much more for the cries of a young girl than a boy, for they came within seconds of the shriek. An older lady came by to pick the girl up and follow the same route as the teacher before her. When the girl was safely in the nurses office, the wind picked the leaf up yet again for another few circles around the playground. \n\nThe wind apparently decided it was now bored of this playground and moved it's focal point east into the forest. However the speed was picking up. Apparently the wind was not in a good mood as it only blows this fast when something is about to happen. As the wind picks up, the leaf begins to circle a tree in the forest with such velocity that it manages to cut a small twig off the tree. Suddenly the leaf realizes the wind is continually picking up more than just speed.",
        "Harry stepped outside with his pint, and breathed deep the crisp autumn oxfordian air. *A beautiful night*, he thought, as he stared up into the deep expanse above, twinkling with stars. \n\"Do - do you want to learn about astronomy, farmer?\" A voice and a chuckle came from one of the tables laid on the street. \n\"I'm sorry?\" Harry turned politely to face his addresser. Sat at the table, cloaked in black, were two young men, chuckling to one another and passing cheap wine between them. A flash of irritation hit him, as he realised who addressed him; that most obnoxious of sub-species, *students*. \n\"*I said*.... would you like to learn about astronomy, farmer? After all, you *are* ignorant of the majesty of the heavens.\" \nA blank look, that swapped to an obsequious smile on Harry's face as he worked out his response. \n\"Oh yes, zur,\" he started, accent slipping to a mimicry of his father's. \"Oh yes, I would loike to learn about the ztars. Oi've alwayz wondered about them, but never got no learning. No zur.\" The students grinned, and one took a breath to begin his patronising lecture. \n\"Well, you see...\" \n\"After all, zur,\" Harry interrupted, \"it's not loike as a farmer Oi learnt to read the skoi to know the zeasons, or the weather. Now moi brother, *he* knowz the skoi. A sailor, see?\" The two lads looked nonplussed. \"They've been navigating boi the ztars for years. And he'd never tell me nothin'. As a farrmer, why, Oi've never got lost walking and used Polaris to orientate moiself. No zur.\" The glares indicated they had caught on. He grinned. \n\"*How* dare you? Don't you know who we are?\" Demanded one of the pair, slamming his fist on the table. \n\"Yes I do.\" Harry answered.",
        "The ever dutiful machines whirred and hummed around me. Every bone and muscle in my poor tired body screamed with the familiar pain. \"I swear this is my last contract.\" I thought it every time, but this time I meant it. Just like every time before, I suppose. I drank the electrolyte supplements, the protein supplements, and the Carbohydrate supplements, each one more foul and bitter than the last. I washed the stimulants down with water and got out of the Assisted Hibernation suit to put on my uniform. I must have been one of the first up, as I didn't see anyone else in the locker room. The computer informed me we were home. Anticipating the awakening of the other crew members I dusted off the Champagne and put it on Ice. \n\nI sat down at the terminal. \"This is Exploratory Probe Six-Eight-Twelve, Do you read me\" \n\nStatic. \n\nMicrometeorites must have bombarded the communication array, I'd try again when we entered visual range. It was strange, no one else had woken yet. I climbed back up to the center of the ship where it is weightless, where the Assisted Hibernation pods were to check on the rest of the crew. None of them were dead, but they all read Status Critical: Oversleep; Can not Waken. Fortunately we would be in orbit in less than an hour, and I'd be able to pass this problem to more experienced hands. \n\nI went back down to the Communications Array, where the Champagne sat on Ice. There was a shimmering blue star up ahead, Earth! No need to let all this Champagne go to waste. I uncorked some of the bubbly. Much to my surprise, I had to pull the cork out, and when I poured it it seemed kind of flat. Thank Corporate, always cutting corners. I poured myself a glass, toasted to my terminal, and took a sip. \n\nTHE FUCK. It bit my tongue, not with the bubbles but with a woody sharp taste, it was like licking a tree or an old leather bound book. Something was flashing on the terminal. \"Hyperdrive Failure\" I wasn't from engineering, so I wasn't equipped to deal with that. \n\nThe Blue Dot was the size of my pinky nail, even with a shot com array, we HAD to be in range now. I raised them again. A few measured beeps, but mostly static. Hell, last mission, autopilot would have taken over by now, correcting our orbit and preparing us for unload, crew update, and redeployment. \n\nI spent a few hours running diagnostics on the com system and checking internal fuses. Everything was in order. By now I could make out clouds and continents. We were approaching from the Solar side, so it was a beautiful blue-green marble, dolloped with swirling clouds. I took a few snaps of it for my family, they seemed to love those. The only replies I could raise were from automatic satellites, and even their responses were spotty at best.",
        "My body shuddered against the metal bars of the cage where they held me. It was only a matter of time now before someone would come to take me away. Somewhere down the hall a sink was running and the water dripped over onto the floor. It was the only sound I heard aside from my own heartbeat. I knew this day was coming for so long but nothing prepares you for it. I had always thought maybe I would be overlooked or spared but that thinking was na\u00efve. \n\nI heard the stories growing up that if you were a hard worker you could be saved. They would grant you Pilgrim status for being a valuable member of society. As a kid I wish they would have just told me that was bullshit. I worked hard and in the end it was for nothing. I somehow thought that because I was the son of a Pilgrim it would be better for me. \n\nMy father was a Breeder. He was a Pilgrim whose sole purpose was to create the Shells and for some reason I thought maybe he would see a connection with me. He had already moved on before I had grown up, I hadn't seen him since I was a child. I remember being in bed just wondering what it feels like to burn through bodies like that. \n\nI heard someone walking down the hallway and before long the sink had stopped dripping. I knew this was meant for me. I could feel it. My teeth rattled in my head and I shook, feeling an overwhelming nervousness I wasn't ready for. \n\nThe guards opened my cell and restrained me but I couldn't fight them if I wanted to. I was always relatively weak and at this moment I had mostly accepted what was to come. We walked for what seemed forever, passing the cells of the others who would have their bodies repurposed and I felt pity for them. Not all were taking this as well as I was. \n\nWe passed through a gate and the guards gave a nod to a man with a key standing in front of a big laboratory door. The white finish seemed out of place amongst the rusted metals and cracking concrete of the preceding room. They brought me in and immediately all eyes were upon me.",
        "*\" Approaching final landing sequence, vector correction thrusters online. Steady her out, Lieutenant. \"* \n\n*\" Roger that, Captain. Thrusters steadying. Applying left rudder, 6 degrees. Quartermaster, can you see anything yet? \"* \n\nThe Quartermaster didn't respond. His mouth hung agape as they dipped below the clouds, the surface of the beautiful planet coming into view for the first time to human eyes. Dense jungles surrounded coastlines that were lapped by beautiful, crystal waters. Out of the port side windows, beautiful flowing sand dunes were dotted by huge.... wait, what the fuck? \n\n*\" Are.... are those pyramids? Captain, can you confirm visual? \"* \n\nEveryone sat shocked within the craft. The landing suffered from the sudden loss of attention to the controls. A massive shudder gave way to a very bumpy landing, jostling around the crew and some tools inside. This didn't faze the crew, however; they all but burst out of their seats and into the expanse of desert they had chosen to land on. With awe struck glances exchanged, the crew scrambled up the dune before them and stared silently at the sight before them. \n\n*\" Lieutenant, tell me you see this. Those.... those are Egyptian pyramids. The people down there, are they...? \"* \n\nThe Captain trailed off, but Lt. knew what he was asking. Yes, those were Egyptian style pyramids. And yes, those appeared to be human beings gathered in the city before them. A small group was heading their way, shadowed by the wavy heat radiating off the desert sands. This was incredible. The Captain began calling the ground crew back on Earth, and the conversation was short and sweet. \n\n*\" Captain, this is very important. Take pictures and document everything.

        "Dr. Probability sat handcuffed in a holding cell in Diamond City's central police station. Five hours ago the infamous terrorist cell, Dragon's Bane, attempted to pull off a series of attacks that would have taken thousands of lives and left the city in shambles. Dr. Probability called in the threat and based off his ability was able to direct authorities to the probable locations the Dragon's Bane would strike. As always he was right. A few of the terrorists deviated from their plans and some were able to do damage before taken down. In all 47 were injured, and 1 was killed. Though the city sends their best support to those grieving families, many are grateful nothing worse came to city of nearly half a million. \n\nWhen Dr. Probability entered the police cruiser, he was being taken once again to city hall to shake hands with the mayor. Except this time when he arrived downtown, he was arrested under probable cause he knew of the attack and maybe even had a hand in orchestrating it. \n\n\u201c How did you know there was going to be an attack?!?! \u201d Detective Reeves yelled slamming his fists on the table \u201c Tell me know! \u201d Dr. Probability looked the detective in the eyes. \u201c Last week DB made a threat against our nation. Given our mayor's recent speech condemning Dragon's Bane, there was a probability of 33 in 40 that we would be the next target. I then went to our Herbert Park and waited for signs of an impending attack. This afternoon I saw a van pull up and explosives being subtly unloaded. I then called the authorities and advised of the other probable locations. \u201d \u201c Bullshit! \u201d Detective Reeves exclaimed, \u201c After every catastrophic event. You are always there at the center of all. The whole city thinks you're a hero. \u201d Detective Reeves took a mocking tone, \u201c There is a 1 in 3 chance that this bank will be robbed at noon, there is a 4 in 9 chance the chief of police is having an affair, \u201d the detective began reverting back to his angry tone \u201c there is a 87 in 88 chance I have been bullshitting you all! The other officers might eat your shit all day, but I DON'T BUY IT!!! \u201d The detective slammed his fists against the metal desk again. \n\nDr. Probability was unfazed by the detective's tone.

        "A painter's work is never complete, even as I add the last touches to the canvas now smeared with thick streaks to represent the water lilies in front of me. The lead paints let my head flutter for a moment before I took a sip of gin peering into the water as the sun painted its own majesty with golden rays across the pond. I realized long ago I could never reach the ideals of the old Renaissance painters who tried to compare their works to the masterpieces of Heaven; impressionism never tried to reach for such foolish heights. Instead the canvas allows us to express our innermost thoughts with the brush. If my work only spoke about the sorrow I've experienced, the joy I've found, and the regret I've found in life in imperfect strokes, I consider my work far more valuable than the stark reality Da Vinci has crafted. \n\nAs I packed my materials, a flash of light illuminated from the corner of my eye. Yet another person clad in strange clothes ran to me and begging me for audience. I simply waved them away and continued, supplies in hand, to the street. \n\n\u201c Mr. van Gogh, please, \u201d she pleaded, much like the rest. \u201c You need to listen to me. \u201d \n\nI simply ignored them and walked into the street, knowing most of these people don't dare to confront me in public. They all knew my name and hurled themselves at me, but the moment I walk to anywhere with other people, they recede, but reinvade my personal time as I try to paint. At first, I figured they were a prank meant to detract from my art by mocking my failures with false promises of fame, as if anyone would dare cast their gaze upon my paintings and see anything beyond the surface level, but their sheer number and insistence convinced me otherwise. \n\nPerhaps the alcohol has finally invaded my spirit and these men and women are naught but delusions meant to torment me. Perchance I've simply gone mad; after all they refuse to appear in public leaving me the fool to insist their existence. If the former, I can still paint in peace letting the delusions shape and form art. If the latter, I know I can still paint a sky flooded with stars behind the bars of an asylum.",
        "Journal, \n\nI still remember the first time. \n\nIt was after Christmas, and they had given him to me. I think it was the first time that I've ever experienced something akin to happiness. I was forced to live out my deepest desires all this time in my head. **Use your imagination, Doug**. Dad always thought he could help me that way -- but I think he always knew it would end this way -- which is why he brought me this gift. \n\nI had taken him apart and placed him in neat, little bags, which I tried to dispose of in some trash cans a few blocks down.

I've got this beat in my head, and I just got ta bang it out.\" I picked up a metal rod on the ground near the refuse and struck the lid of the can. Again, and again, I crafted a rhythmic beat. \n\n\"Bangin' on a trash can?\" Skeeter asked, \"EPIC! Let me find an instrument!\" And he ran off. \n\nI'd have to find a better way.

        "I am not a great writer nor have the time to write a good short story. Here is my basic outline - \n\nMichael recognizes the voice of President Obama on Call of Duty in January 2011, while playing at his home in Missouri. He is 15. Obama tries to deny it, but Michael catches him in several logical fallacies and get him to admit his identity. Michael blackmails him into being is Call of Duty partner, and Obama agrees to secure Micheal's silence about the fact that he has logged hundreds of hours of CoD during his presidency and is secretly suffering a debilitating addiction to the game. \n\nAfter being forced into a 7 hour straight marathon of Call of Duty for Micheal's birthday in May of that year, Obama begins to devise a plan for revenge. Over the course of the year, he begins to intentionally lower his Call of Duty skills, until early February of 2012, when Micheal notices he is has been playing better than Obama for months, and asks what the problem is. Obama tries to deny anything is wrong, but eventually puts into play the next part of his plan. He tells Micheal that the stresses of the Middle East conflicts are growing to great, and it is effecting his playing, but tells Micheal for now there is nothing he can do, and he hopes the situation will get better soon. \n\nA month later, Obama tells Micheal that there is a new development in the Middle East conflict. The CIA has become extremely concerned with the rise of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and his Islamic State of Iraq, and some of his new advances into areas of Iraq formerly held by Us troops. In reality, the intelligence at the time was indicating that the Islamic State of Iraq was not a threat, but Obama had a plan. He told Micheal that they were beginning covert offenses using a new robotic drone technology. Rather than missles shot from drone planes, a secret US arms corporation had developed a small all terrain robot outfitted with a wide variety of minature high powered weaponry. This new technology is so controversial that no officers within the US defense network low enough in rank to take the time to pilot the drones can be trusted to do it. So this secret arms corporation, in conjunction with the major multinational banks, forced Obama to use a new software that would allow the drones to be piloted by unwitting Call of Duty players. The new software would alter the game to show the terrain and combatants rendered into whatever level and enemy they are fighting against. If he does not comply they are threatening another JFK style assassination.",

It was getting bigger with each day, and soon it would swallow their home. Neither of them knew what would come after they survived the sun's impending death. The earth was soon to face cremation, and they would be hurled into the vast emptiness of space. Would they be able to face this together, or would the event be so violent that such would be an impossibility? They would find out soon enough. \n\nThe couple hadn't spoken in years. She hadn't said much after the last of humanity died out. He knew she felt guilty, but he didn't blame her. They spent many care-free centuries together and she couldn't have possibly known it would come to this. Still, she felt as if this was their punishment, and for that- for the deal she made for her and her husband- she was sorry. \n\nThe man looked at his wife. She looked back soberly, her eyes puffy and welling with tears. \n\n\"Don't\", the man said. \n\n\"I'm s-\" \n\n\"Do you remember when we met? You were sitting outside of school, your ride had just left you. Do you remember?\" \n\nShe nodded, and he could see the corner of her lips begin to make a smile.",
        "This is it, a typical Thursday night. The clock staring at me from across the empty tavern, ticking away and weaving with the low music in the background. I drum my fingers against the wooden surface at the bar and I look down at my legs, sore from standing for hours on end. \n\nMy phone vibrates in my pocket and I pull it out quickly, looking at the time again. Had it really only been 2 minutes since I last checked? I look at the clock on the wall, then back to the phone and exhale. I check who the text is from, and I smile. Even with something as simple as \"How's work?\" I can tell that she cares. \n\nI send her a quick reply, keeping her in mind as I tuck the phone away, straighten my back and stretch.",
        "\"Mo.\" I rub my eyes with my hand. \"It's four in the morning. You have not teleported. It's just a dream.\" \n\nThe line crackled as Mo let out an exasperated sigh. \"No, Becks. That's the thing. It's actually real!\" \n\n\"Okay.\" In my half-waking state, I was willing to humor her. \"Tell me what happened, then. How did you finally manage to crack this code?\" \n\n\"Well, you know how I've been trying to get to the park bench for a while now?\" \n\n*A while? Try four years. * I bit back the sarcastic comment. \"Yes.\" \n\n\"Since that's been a total bust so far, I decided I should try out different locations. I thought, maybe the issue isn't that I'm trying to go to far. Maybe it's that I'm not going far *enough. *\" \n\n\"What?\" I sat up in bed. \"What are you talking about?\" \n\nMo giggled. \"Guess where I am right now.\" \n\n\"Paris? I don't know.\" \n\n\"Nope.\" She sounded so giddy. It was really throwing me. \"I'm in...\" She cut herself off with another laugh. \"The outer stratosphere.\" \n\nI hesitated. \"You.... what?\" \n\n\"I'm almost up in space.\" A breeze rushed by, causing a ripple of static. \"Oh man, I think I'm going to try for the moon.\" \n\nI froze. \"The moon?\" \n\n\"Wouldn't that be *crazy? \"* \n\n\"Don't do it!\" I blurted out. \n\nMo paused. \"What?\" \n\n\"Um...\" Inspiration hit me. \"I mean, don't do it *yet. * Could you, uh, FaceTime me? Right now? I want to see the view from up where you are.\" \n\n\"Oh! Sure. Hold on.\" \n\nThe line went silent for a moment. I chewed my knuckle, heart racing. *Come on, * I prayed. *Call back. Come on. * \n\nFinally, my phone rang again. I breathed a sigh of relief as I saw that it was indeed a FaceTime request from Mo's number.",
        "I was trying to focus my battered camera on a spectacularly odd-looking elderly couple at the foot of Huayna Picchu when I felt a soft touch on my shoulder. It was Oscar, the stumpy native who had been assigned to drag our pale, unprepared bodies across 26 miles of Incan heritage; reluctantly, no doubt. \n\nOscar didn't look happy. Not just in this moment, but ever. But in this moment, also. Without speaking a word he led me to a nearby rock and gestured his hand in a way that insisted I sit down. \n\n\"I receive text from hostel\", Oscar's English wasn't perfect, but you never struggled to understand what he was saying. \"Your mother was in touch. She wants you to know that Billy has dead\". \n\nThat moment there. When those last three words - just four measly syllables, a calamity of 12 damned letters - when that reached my ear and triggered the connectivity in my brain that deals with understanding. That moment there, I felt the ground move from under me, and I knew I was the only one to feel it. \n\nThe rock I was sitting on sank lower than my heart and I was now looking up at Oscar through flooded pupils. His head remained bowed whilst he asked who Billy was to me. Moments later his stubby arms were wrapped around my head and he was crying now too. \"I also lost a brother\", he sobbed in my ear. \"Lo siento mucho.\" \n\nOscar pulled some strings with another tour guide and secured me a seat on a coach that was heading back to Cuzco. I was sitting behind the spectacularly odd-looking elderly couple. They had Southern American accents. Go figure. The journey back was painfully long but it gave me time to reflect on the life I had shared with my little brother. \n\nHe was a pain in the ass, but such a good kid. We were inseparable at home. He was six years my junior, so we didn't spend much time out of the house together - except for our evening games of football. I used to stick him in goal and practise my penalties on him. It was pretty cruel but I insisted on always playing in the goal with no net. It was my lucky goal, and he was a champion at bringing it back. Billy didn't have many other friends either, he was always at home, and when I'd get in he'd be bugging me to play games with him or make food for him.",
        "Beezlebub drifted hazily awake, and immediately wished he hadn't. His head felt like someone had pierced it with their pitchfork and there was a crust of something gold and sticky smeared across his left hindquarter. It hadn't been a good night. \n\nHe gazed blearily around him. His legs were stretched out over the tattered remains of what had once been a very nice couch (maybe one of the ones that had come down with Ghengis Khan?) which since fallen heavily from grace and now resided in a dingy apartment in southwest third circle, Hell. Through the window he could make out the harsh neon light of the sign from the brothel next door, Kingdom Cum. \n\nHe stood up and winced as his torn-up hooves met the flaming floor. \n\n\"Yo Beez, you up?\" \n\nIt was his sometimes-girlfriend, Lucy Furr. Lucy was a part-time dancer at the KC next door, and she definitely looked the part -- smooth humanoid curves and long muscular legs all covered in a fine layer of black peach fuzz. Ravishing. Today, she had big lumps of black sheep wool wrapped around each of her four calves. \n\n\"What the heaven is that?\" Beezlebub scoffed, gesturing at her footwear. \"You look like a cancerous donkey.\" \n\nShe walked in and threw a balled-up hamburger wrapper at him. \n\n\"They're called leg-warmers, dipshit.\" \n\nShe paused studied his face intently. \n\n\"It's a human thing,\" she said softly. \n\nHe froze. \n\n\"You went up? How? When? Where?\" \n\nNo demon had gained access to the human world since years earlier when a few had climbed thtough the hole left after Hiroshima. \n\nShe nodded. \"There's a small cavern we found in a place called San Francisco. Apparently there's a lot of gay people there so some Christians have been building a little passageway down here to try to get rid of them.\" \n\nBeezlebub blinked. \"But why the fuck would we care..\" \n\nLucy shrugged impatiently. \"Who knows? Point is we can get back up, and there's been a lot going on up there since the thirties. There are some pretty interesting new inventions floating around in 1989.\" \n\nBeezlebub snorted. \"I wouln't call ugly socks an interesting invention.\"",
        "*The Year: 2116* \n\n*The Place: Washington, D.C.* \n\n*News Reporter: * This week marks the 100th anniversary of Congress's historic 2016 Prohibition Act criminalizing crack caffeine, often known to users as \"coffee\". \n\nCrack caffeine was originally banned because of its contributing role in a variety of social ills, including but not limited to heart disease, type A personalities, overwork, and poor dental health. While crack caffeine is a stimulant, historians have cited its history as an opiate of the masses, making them believe that the oppression of the 9 to 5 workday and the 40 hour workweek was bearable. \n\nIn recent years, however, scientists have begun experimenting with the drug. While these experiments have mainly been limited to non-human subjects, a few prominent companies are poised to start trials administering small drips to humans. It is postulated that crack caffeine's effect on depressed subjects may give it some medicinal merit. \n\nIn this respect, policy seems on pace to outstrip science. Oregon and Washington state, historic crack caffeine hubs, and Washington, D.C., a city where many prominent citizens, including Congresspeople, have been accused of being coffeeheads, are considering legislation to decriminalize crack caffeine. These regions have already instituted policies allowing for medical use of condensed crack caffeine, known to users as \"chocolate\". \n\nThere is no word yet on whether the federal government will continue to enforce crack caffeine prohibitions in states in which it is decriminalized; the federal government is waiting to see if this legislation becomes law. \n\nBack to you, Diana.",
        "\"Listen, Mr Fluffles, there's a reason we're called'man's best friend'. That title didn't come cheap\". Toby was getting agitated now - the Feline Federation were making preposterous demands.\"Dogs have been hunting with humans for thousands of years, providing food and companionship. It's only fair that, as humans chosen best friend, dogs should inherit the Earth. It just makes sense\", the grumpy Basset Hound continued. \n\n\"And what makes you think you have the ability to handle it?\", purred Mr Fluffles, president of the Feline Federation. He was a sinister looking Siamese, holding court from his Executive Play Tower \u00a9. Cardboard boxes were piled around him, holding the supreme Feline council, smugness emanating from their finely cleaned fur like a gas leak. \n\nThe dogs howled in anger.\"Just look at us, noble creatures with brains considerably bigger than your largest, diabetic mouser\". Toby snorted with derision.\" The idea that you could do anything better than us is simply ridiculous. You have one day to leave the court before our Mastiffs will be forced to evict you\". \n\nFluffles rose to his full height now, a full two feet above the carpeted platform. Fore paws hanging in front of him, Fluffles cleared his throat.\"My dear Toby, you're right - dogs have hunted with humans, and protected their children, and defended their homes. Noble creatures indeed. But what did you get in return? Table scraps, a kennel? A nice short lead? We felines have been using humans since the end of the ice age.",

You're acting strange. This is how this works, these drug deals.

I'm going to arrest his ass and find the goods.\" \n\nThey both smirked and motioned for their pockets. \n\n\"What the fuck! Don't move,\" snarled Mike. \n\n\"You don't move first,\" replied Jim. \n\n\"OK, I won't move first then you won't move.\" \n\n\"So I get the first move?\" asked Jim with a smirk. \n\n\"Shit, I guess so.\" \n\nIn a swift motion, Jim whipped out his.38 Special and slapped the butt across Mike's sweaty temple with a dull thud. \n\nMike cried out and reached for his pocket but Jim's knee landed heavily on his wrist, snapping it in three places. He lay in defeat. \n\nJim pulled a zip-tie out of his pocket and expertly bound Mike's wrists. \n\n\"You're under arrest, dick bag.\" \n\n\"Jesus Christ,\" Mike muttered through pain-gritted teeth. \n\n\"Yeah, you're fucked.\" \n\n\"The war on fucking drugs, my ass.

        "8 months since since everything changed. When I dream, it is not the fantasies I used to have, but memories of the time before. I dream of a time when I wasn't weary, when I wasn't hungry, when I still had my old family. \nI have a new family now. There is less warmth but we look after one another. It is better in some ways; I used to be a father, that brought responsibilities, expectations, I had to lead. Not now. As part of this group life is tougher, it is hardly safe to sleep and there is never enough food. Yet now I have left the duties of parenthood, my job and my life behind, I am an equal for the first time. I am complete. \nWithin this group we are not friends, we are survivors. We do not love each other, but we need each other and we trust each other. \n\nThe city is not safe. Too many rooftops, too many blocked alley ways. But there is food here, that is why people risk coming. Ahead of us a scavenger is picking through the debris, there's a gun slung across his back so we will have to kill him, no question. It is just a shame there is only one of him, more scavengers means more food. There's a good chance he'll take one of us with him but we can't leave him alive, with a gun to our backs. \n\nHe is focused on unearthing whatever it is that he can see beneath the rubble. This should could go quite well for us. We creep slowly as blood races through our veins. Pupils dilated, mouth salivating, yet we tread lightly. He pauses, none of us even draws breath. He continues digging and we continue advancing towards his back. But he has heard us, he turns and the gun is in his hands.",
        "Leave Out All The Rest - Linkin Park \n\nI had a dream last night. A dream I went missing. *She* was so scared.... so freaking scared. She thought I killed myself. She thought I was dead. But no one would listen to her. Why? Cause no one cared. But that was just a dream. \n\nI woke up this morning feeling depressed, as usual. I've been like this for a long time. That's why I'm writing you this note. If you're asking me, I want you to know that my time has come. And my suffering will be over. But when that happens, please, forget the wrong that I've done. Help me leave behind some reasons for people to miss me. Leave out all the rest. Leave out all of the pain I've caused. I live with this guilt, and I can't take it anymore. Guilt that never leaves my heart. Forget what I've done. Forget what I've done to them. Forget what I've done to you. Remember the good in me. Please. I'm begging you. Don't resent me.

        "\"How does it feel?\" I breathed. \n\nThree men draped in dark cloaks towered over me. I couldn't see their faces but I wasn't worried about their faces. My eyes were drawn to the long wooden scythe held out before me. It appeared old, aged, yet somehow untouched by time. My heart raced as I followed the wooden handle all the way up to the curved blade baring the marks of many conquests. \n\nFinally the hooded man replied in a voice that sounded low and calculated, \"It feels cold.\" \n\nI returned my eyes to the men in front of me. I could hardly believe what was happening. I wasn't sure if it was the weight of my backpack on my back or what but my chest felt tight. I mean I'm only fourteen! Just minutes ago I was walking home from class and now.... \n\nI swallowed hard, staring at the men. \"You want- want me to co- come?\" \n\nThe hood nodded and reeled his arms back, placing the scythe upright. \n\nI straightened and asked. \"How do I know this isn't a setup? How do I know you're not going to kill ME?\" \n\nThe three hoods looked at each other before turning to me. The one with the scythe replied, \"You wouldn't know. You wouldn't hear us. You wouldn't see us. You would simply die.\" \n\nA pang in my chest caused me to grip the straps of my backpack and readjust. \"I just- I don't understand. How can THIS be my job? Usually you aren't assigned a job till you're sixteen. Plus this isn't even a job. Do you even have a boss? Do you get paid? Raise a family? I just- I don't understand.\" \n\n\"This is a job.\" The hood spoke. \"Yes we have a boss. Yes we get paid. No...\" His glove hand squeaked as it tightened around the wood. ``.... we don't have families.\" \n\nMy thoughts raced as fast as my heart. Shocked, I scrambled for more answers. \"So you DO work for someone? And you're given money? But how? Why? I don- I know I keep saying it but it's true - I don't understand.\" \n\nThe hooded man replied. \"Stop.\" He comanded. \"You already know you have two choices. Choice one: you take the job assigned to you. Do this and you become one of us. We will show you the art and beauty of death. Your mind, body and soul will be transformed - for better or for worse. Choice two: you refuse your assignment and go with the dissenters.\" \n\nI gulped. \"What about my...\" \n\n\"Choose.\" \n\nI closed my eyes knowing I only had one real choice to make. I couldn't go with the dissenters. They lived in the Outskirts from where no one returned. To be thrown out and join them would be a decision worse than death.",

        "The community centre was in dire need of a makover; the council had really let things slip. There were more broken and boarded up windows than intact ones, broken bottles littered the pavement outside the entrance, and the distinct smell of urine pierced the air as you walked towards the door. Inside wasn't much better; a floor in need of sweeping, a corridor lined with damaged doors, and damp climbing the walls. \n\nAs I stood in the corridor looking around, a scrawny, bald, rat-like man jerked into my personal space. \n\n\"Hi mate!.... not seen you here before!.... You been in yet?\" \n\"Hi.... No\" I said, as the man's full-body nervous twitches wafted the smell of cigarette smoke in my face. \n\n\"I'm Gaz, follow me chap, it's this way\" \n\nAs Gaz turned sharply his long over-sized leather jacket swung around with him and he walked erratically down the corridor. I looked him up and down as I followed and noticed three red glowing numbers across the back of his head. \n\n\"666\" I unintentionally said out loud. \n\n\"Yes mate.... Born with it.... is it glowing again?\" Gaz said casually. \n\n\"Yeah\" I said, confused. \n\n\"Does that sometimes, means sod all from what I can tell.... got no correlation to anything... What you here for?\" He asked as he carried on juddering down the corridor. \n\n\"Dragon on my back.... doesn't glow though\" I told him. \n\n\"Be thankful for that!.... it's even harder to convince them you aren't special when it glows!\" \n\nAt this he pushed open a door revealing an odour of coffee and the sound of chattering voices. In the centre of the room was a circle of chairs seating by most people's standards, probably the weirdest group of individuals they've ever seen.

        "I have the feeling that I've been here before, on this exact spot, in this exact place and time, but I know for sure that it's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at best. Don't get me wrong, I know I've been in similar situations before. I mean, there was that time with the pills, and that time when I was sitting in my car, with the garage door closed. Oh, and how could I forget that time with the oven, funny how such things turn trivial as time moves on, though I didn't know it was electric, at the time. But I know for sure that I have never been in this place before, as today is the first time that I actually feel courageous enough to go though with my plan. I can see that I'm confusing you, so let me just start at the beginning. \n\nMy life hasn't always exactly been the easiest, but I guess the series of events that brought me here, started around year five in school. When I was around ten years old, I collapsed while playing outside with some friends. I still remember that bizarre experience of playing ball one moment, and falling down the other, having lost all feeling in my legs. It felt like someone suddenly flipped a switch somewhere in my brain, and turned off my legs. I was rushed to the hospital, of course. I must've fallen asleep at some point, or I simply forgot, but the next thing I remember is lying in a bed, with a doctor poking needles in my legs. He then took my parents into the hallway, and a few moments later I heard my mom scream hysterically. My dad walked back into the room with tears in his eyes. \n\nIt turned out I have a rare autoimmune disease that targets my peripheral nervous system. In short, my body attacks its own nervous system, resulting in (partial) paralysis, or worse. After a few weeks in the hospital, and several dozens of tests, they told me I was one of the lucky ones. After weeks of rehabilitation I was finally able to walk again. I was sent home. I don't think I ever saw my parents so happy, my sister was literally crying when I walked through the door. I felt like I was invincible. Even now, after all those years, I sometimes wish I could relive that moment just one more time. \n\nUnfortunately, it turned out I wasn't exactly invincible after all, and every few years or so, my immune system would kick into overdrive again, and the whole story would repeat from the beginning. Falling. Hospital. Rehabilitation. Falling. Hospital. Rehabilitation. An endless cycle of hope and despair. I never was much of a learner, but I missed so many days in school that my grades plummeted. I barely saw my friends anymore, as I couldn't play outside, even in my better days. Especially going through puberty was hell, though because of my wheelchair I got treated quite nicely in school, so I had that going for me. Though as a more or less permanent wheelchair-bound teenager with little to no social life, I could have probably starred on the cover of *Troubled* magazine. \n\nThe depressions started around that time as well. Whole days went by when I could do nothing except lying in bed, alone with my thoughts, and feeling powerless. Staring into a black pit of uselessness, having no desire to do anything at all, and feeling like all the joy and happiness in the world had been sucked out of me. Even as puberty made way for adulthood, the depression stayed. In fact, I think it got worse as years went by. My parents, my sister, probably knew. I realised that they took extra care to be nice to me, to try and make me feel happy, and somewhere deep down I appreciated their effort. I didn't show it, however. In fact, the more they tried to engage with me, the more they tried to find a way to make me feel happy, to make me feel me again, the more I pushed them away.",
        "Sean sighed and turned back to Jordan, hopelessness scrawled across his pale features in the near darkness. \"Face it. We're lost.\" \n\n\"No, we're not,\" Jordan's out of breath reply came from just within earshot as he struggled to catch up. He poked his head out from behind a nearby oak. \"Look, I know it seems like we are, but we only left camp half an hour ago. We can't be that far away, and besides, we can just wait until it gets light tomorrow morning to go back.\" \n\nSean shook his head in frustration, then recoiled roughly as something hit his head from above. \"Damn it, J, now it's starting to rain. Got any bright ideas?\" \n\nTo his annoyance, Jordan grinned at him and pointed off to their left. There was a rocky outcropping with a crevice at the bottom that seemed just big enough to fit the two of them inside. Jordan was already jogging over to investigate. \n\n\"Watch it, moron, hundred dollars there are snakes in there,\" Sean called after him before reluctantly following. But Jordan had already disappeared into the ground, and his voice echoed back up out of what was clearly not just a tiny crevice. \n\n\"Get down here, man. This is insane!\" \n\nSean laid down on his stomach and slid under the rock, his initial feeling of claustrophobia instantly dispelled by the spacious cavern he now found himself in. \n\n\"Deja vu, am I right?\" Jordan piped back up. \n\n\"Not really, no,\" came Sean's reply. \"I can't even see anything. It's almost pitch black.\" \n\nJordan chuckled. \"Okay, yeah. I know we were just outside in a little light, and it's really dark in here. But this cave, when we came in.... if you close your eyes - does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?\" \n\n\"Uh...\" \n\n\"And if you close you eyes - does it almost feel like you've been here before? *Serious* deja vu, dude.\"",
        "\"Social Engineering\". Those words just slide off the tongue like butter don't they. Here, say them with me, go ahead. Social Engineering. See? I just got you to say Social Engineering. Isn't it great? \n\nI've always said that once you can fake sincerity you've got it made. Dress the part, get the right haircut, have a smile like a single, huge gleaming tooth, and just the right grip to the handshake and you become CEO just like that. Office ID? Hah, get a Discordian \"Official Pope\" card with a good picture, laminate that bad boy, and you're golden like an apple. \n\nSo I \"worked\" for Turnkey Synergy Inc. a year back or so. By worked, I mean I showed up like I was supposed to be there, picked a cubicle, and was good to go. I was really hired by Synergistic Proactive Associates to help them get a little edge on the competition. \n\nThe senior accountant of TSI was really uptight about her desk, see? Everything in place, in order, sorted, color coded, indexed, filed, alphabetic, paper clips no staples, etc, yadda, blah. Right. All I had to do was push a single pencil out of line by the merest fraction, or slightly lower the monitor. The best was turning her family photos upside down in their frames because she might not notice. Until I approached her desk as the perfect, chipper employee and pointed it out to her, of course. All in good cheer. Good heavens would she get red and cranky (but not at me, never at me). \n\nHaving flowers sent to happily married John from the HR assistant Toni was a nice touch. A few whispered words got Toni fired and I think John's living in a hotel now. Eh, his wife is mean anyway, he can do better. \n\nAnother great trick was puting USB thumb drives all over the parking lot. You should have seen IT running around that week. The payload was signed by the lead developer's private key. Man. Rotten luck. It took days for them to even discover the ssh connections to The Ukraine. \n\nOf course I wasn't above petty aggrivations. Hiding the toilet paper. Eating someone else's lunch and leaving the leftovers on the Intern's desk. Setting popcorn in the microwave to 20 minutes. An old ipod in the ceiling with a cheap speaker playing, over an over again, a high pitched squeal that was just barely audible to human hearing (I had to grin and bear that one myself). \n\nI'd steal things from Bob's desk and put them on Alice's desk. Sometimes in plain sight, while they were watching. Because I'd use a little magic called \"misdirection\". Slides off the tongue like silk. Here, say it with me, \"misdirection\". See, you didn't even notice I mispelled msdirection the first time. \n\nI turned in my reports on time and always had a slap on the back and a hail and well met for everyone. I brought in doughnuts and cookies.",
        "The tour guide looked insulted but my frat Bros just laughed. I threw a dip in my mouth and spilt from the group. As I stumbled around I quickly became disoriented and wound up in long hall filled with suits of armor. \n\nAt the end of the line I spotted the freshest medieval gear I had ever seen. I honestly think the bro had metal boat shoes and an izod logo on his chest. I was pretty drunk though so maybe not. \n\nThen I saw the plaque above his armor. Sir Thad The Dong Windlow. \"The dong, fucking epic!\" I said as I noticed one last piece of the majestic throne to The Dong. \n\nEvery knight had a special item next to their armor. Most were pretty lame like flutes, crosses, and kerchiefs. The dong was special though, this bro had a solid gold chamber pot that you just know doubled as a spitter \"no natty ice cans back in the day!\" I said in my mind. \n\nTo show my honor to the dong I whipped mine out and took a piss. As the first drop hit the gold the world began to spin and warp, growing massive and shrinking at the same time. Tripping balls would be considered an under statement. When the trip stop I was in the same hall but it looked vastly different. \n\nI then felt a metal fist grab the back of my neck. I turn to see a knight stand tall above me. His visor flips up and I see Oakley glass under neath. \n\n\"Bro! Bro? Did you fucking piss in my pot? Bro? Are we Eskimo bros? Please tell me you have some fucking skol.... Wench! Come meet my new bro wench!\"",
        "I don't think there was any rain on that strange day. Simply, the world stopped turning. Sure, the sun rose, and fell away behind the horizon, but everything outside- space I mean- was gone. Telescopes didn't work anymore. Things bent at unnatural angles to accomplish this breakdown of the laws of everything scientific. The moon stayed a waxing gibbous, night after night. \n\nI wasn't honestly sure how I killed God. I was a simple and humble man. But now that I think about it, and I've been thinking for decades now because time is stuck too it seems, I think I met him on a corner. On a corner in the city as I was walking to get coffee. \n\nI had a guy in a big brown coat brush me hard on the shoulder as I came up to the crosswalk, so I was patting myself down of course. I think I had just put my hand on the apartment key when he first said something to me. I wasn't really sure what I just heard, so I looked up. \n\nHe was plain; hadn't shaved today but didn't have a beard. Salt and pepper hair and a pair of glasses that sat on his short nose. \"You look tired.\" \n\nHe was looking me up and down; I figured he was sizing me up. I sized him up too, but I turned my eyes across the street to where the crosswalk ended. \n\n\"You know,\" he said as he lit up a cigarette and put it between his thin lips, \"I think I'm done with this.\" \n\n\"Done with what?\" I asked before I could shut my damn mouth. \n\nHe took a long draw. We kind of stood there amid the horns and heavy truck mufflers of the downtown for a moment. \"This.\" he said, pointing a finger all around him. \n\nI watched his finger, \"What? The city?\" \n\n\"Yea,\" he said taking another draw, \"but not just the city.\" He held the cigarette, cherry up in front of himself and just watched it for a moment.",
        "You know it won't work. It never does. You always wake up and then she is gone, the one who haunts your dreams, never to return. Until the next night, that is. But that has never stopped you from trying. \n\nThe thing about dreams is time goes funny. You can be asleep for thirty minutes, but have a dream that seems to last hours or days. You have no sense of how long it's been or how long you have left, even after you figure out that the vivid sensations are all in your head. You can't really feel the little girl's hand in your own. You can't really smell her tears-free shampoo, the one that is still sitting in the bathroom all these years later because your family can't bear to get rid of it. You can't bear to get rid of it. \n\nThe only thing that really changes is the sensations themselves. Once you know they aren't real, they seem to fade. Except you can still smell that shampoo, and even after you wake it lingers. \n\nIn your dream, you are walking through a park with a little girl who is holding your hand. You know her from somewhere, yet you can not place her in your catalog of acquaintances and friends. Slowly it dawns on you. This is that little girl. The one you know can't be here because she has been gone for years. So how is she here? You don't understand. \n\nAnd then you do. She's not here. This is a dream. The same dream you had last night, and the night before, and the night before that. The same dream that you've had every night since it happened. Since she left you. Since you left her. You really don't know how it happened anymore, but here you are in the same spot it happened that night. You are older and she is the same age, but you never notice that until you wake up. \n\nYou let go of her hand for just a second, like you always do. You never want to. You know it's a bad idea. But you do it anyway. You bend down to tie your shoe. You can't help it. You know you're dreaming but you have yet to change the sequence of events. But tonight is different. Tonight, you hear them coming. Feeling as if you're sinking in mud, moving agonizingly slow, you make yourself stand up. This has never happened before. You have always been a slave to the dream. \n\nYou reach for the girl, your hand moving as if through molasses. Your arm feels like a lead weight, but you have to save her. You have to get her back home or you've failed everyone. You've failed her. No.",
        "\"What the fuck is going on!\" I scream from my front porch as my feet melt from my body. I've never been more scared. Yet, there's an odd feeling that this is meant to happen, the feeling a beatle must have as it morphs from a larve. After the initial shock, I am calm. I accept my coming death. \n\nYet death does not come to me as I am reduced to hideous form. My brain, a covering of skin, and twenty or so new organs that protrude from me like urchin spines are my only bodily remnants as new urge takes over. Find others. I roll to meet people who were once my neighbors, linking our protrusions as we find each other. I can hear their thoughts. Find. Migrate. A signal enters our minds from somewhere unknown. We know our purpose. Buildings, automobiles, disparate parts of what we once called civilization are picked apart systemically, purposefully.",
        "Steven clutched his bag in his arms, breathing frantically as he dodged the trees. \n\nHe could hear the voices of his pursuers. They were getting close. \n\nSteven could not let them have the bag. He had to escape. But he was running out of breath, and he had to hide somewhere. \n\nLuckily, he was small enough to hide under the roots of a massive tree that had grown over a large rock. He tried to catch his breath. \n\n\"Where are you, Steve?\" the voice drew nearer, and Steven held his breath. \"Come out! You know the forest can be dangerous!\" Steven did not move. It was most definitely a ploy. It could not be anything else. \n\nThe voice grew further and further away, and Steven bolted in the opposite direction; they way he had come from. They would never expect that. But he couldn't run forever. He had to go back eventually. The forest was indeed dangerous, and the sun was setting fast. \n\nHis secret place! Steven grinned as he remembered, and cursed himself for not thinking of it sooner. A fallen tree further down south, not five minutes from the point of entry of the forest, made a small hole that was the perfect hiding spot. Steven would usually use that place for solitude, and had never thought of it as a place to hide his treasure. \n\nit was almost dark when Steven, after stashing his bag in the hiding spot, re-emerged from the forest. \n\n\"Oh my God, Steve, don't ever scare us like that again!\" Dad lunged forward and grabbed Steven. He hugged back too. \"You know you're not supposed to go into the forest without us with you! What were you thinking?\" \n\n\"Sorry, Dad,\" Steven used his guiltiest voice. \"I won't do it again.\" He scanned the house; his cousins had left. His little cousins, toddlers, both of them, were a greedy pair.",
        "\u201c I'm sorry, but the thing you were looking for is sold out. \u201d The government agent on the other end of the phone had said the sentence softly, yet firmly. She said nothing more, careful not to waste her resources to reason with a desperate, dying man. \n\nIt couldn't be. There was just no way. When the product first emerged on the market, it was a satire. I purchased a few cans, as did all my friends. We were amused. Who knew, that it would actually catch on. It remained on sale, spreading, like wildfire. People purchased the cans as jokes, to show their friends, to silently protest. The government neither condemned nor encouraged them initially. It knew that attacking the product would give it power. \n\nAs time went on, the pollution spread. Smog that could previously be blocked out by mere masks could now permeate even the best clothing. A fifteen minute walk outside required a ten minute shower to scrub out the dirt and grime. Then the next winter came, a colder one than most. The polar vortex, a term so foreign just half a decade before, was swinging around again. Temperatures dropped continuously, and the heaters in the large city of 25 million burned furiously. After several days, the sun, which during the best of days shredded a yellow, sickly light, was completely covered up by smog. Yet the sky did not clear. The smog would not lift. \n\nThat's when we realized it was no longer a joke. The product was no longer sold in isolated cans anymore. It was sold in huge 4L jugs, even though that was not nearly enough. The government declared martial law. The only vehicles allowed on the road now transported the product, HA! They sold them at exorbitant prices, but it wasn't entirely their fault. There was so little of it, and so many people. \n\nOut of hopelessness I turned to my safe. My apartment, new only several years ago, had walls blackened from dirt. I coughed, creating an explosion of dust, setting off a chain reaction. I finally calmed down a half minute later, and unlocked the metal box.",
        "The heavy doors shut behind me and I wait, making sure the footsteps are far away. One, two, three, four\u2026 even once they are gone and it is completely silent I do not move for a good few moments, collecting my thoughts. Although, once I break out of my stillness, completely ready to face my future, I turn around and pump both my arms up into the air. \n\n\u201c Yesssss! \u201d I yell to myself, unable to stop my sheer joy and excitement. The hall of weapons. Finally. \nI run forward, unsure with where to start because the hall is huge, and I mean huge. The ceiling is metres away and even then the walls are crammed with swords, bows, guns and spears. The floor is organised with shelves, cupboards and tables, each proudly holding its contents. I don't walk, I run to each weapon. I can't deny I am geeking out just a little bit. \n\nI see Excalibur, I see Bruce Lee's nunchuks, Thor's hammer, weapons from legends, weapons from well-known and unknown people that fought in wars from all centuries. Just weapons everywhere. \n\nBut, I keep my hands to myself. I am only allowed to touch what is supposed to be mine. Those are the rules. I am tempted but, after working so hard with the monastery I am not going to ruin it now. So I simply look and gawk. \nNo one really told me how I would know which weapon is mine, all I got from the teachers was, \u2018 you will just know \u2019. \nNot really helpful but I didn't mind entirely, surprises can be good. \n\nAs I walk the adrenaline dies down gradually and I can progress like a normal person. Mainly without uncontrollably flailing my arms about and taking a good minute to remind myself I need to shut my gawking mouth. That is when I hear the high pitched ringing, like a bell has been hit and the elongated, monotone pitch is calling me to follow the sound. I weave in between the objects, following the sound as fast as I can. At one point it starts fading away so I retrace my footsteps and turn the other way. Almost there, almost there, the sound is getting louder and I realise it is coming from above. The weapon is hung on the wall. \n\nLooking up, I see that out of the other weapons it is brighter. Not shining so that I am blinded but just brighter. For a while, I just stand there underneath it, looking up and deep in thought. I can't tell what it is but when it hits me, I am slightly puzzled. A trident. Out of everything I did not think it would be a trident. \n\u201c Poseidon, really? \u201d I say to myself. When I mention the name it glows slightly brighter. Or, that could just be my imagination. \u201c Poseidon? Trident? \u201d I really do not know how I feel. It's so bulky, so ancient, I was hoping for a gun of some kind or even a sword, I could take a sword. \n\nSighing, I grab the ladder which is attached to railings and drag it over. Climbing the rungs, I keep an eye on the weapon, unsure with how I feel. Once close enough, I see it is old and covered in dust. Most of the weapons are but this once just seems to be caked in it. Wiping some of it away, I take a firm grip and pull it out from the clips. I almost fall over and it makes a horrendous metallic sound, but it is out and the dust rises up and clouds around my face.",
        "He'd been practicing lucid dreaming. This idea of being able to control his dreams fascinated him and he would often wander around the world, flying to places he had never been. In fact, this question had pestered him all of his life: \"How can I see things and places I'd never been to?\". \n\nTonight was no different. He'd brushed his teeth, gargled a strong mint flavored mouthwash and jumped straight into bed. As usual, he had set his alarm to 3am. Just enough time to fall into REM sleep and be awaken so he could bring his brain back down to the near meditative state of lucid dreaming. Just before letting his brain go, he repeated to himself in his mind: \"Tonight, I'm gon na figure out the meaning of life. I'm gon na see the source of us all and find out why are we here.\". He was incredibly smart but not especially attractive and by any definition, an underachiever. This would let his brain free to fantasize about being the one who would one day be the most influential person in history. \"I mean, I have the brains, I'm a genius.... it's just that no one realizes it\" - he'd often think to himself. \n\n*BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP* \n\nNo matter for how long he'd been doing this, he'd get the heavy head feeling every time the alarm went off. But he always instinctively knew what he had to do. He flipped his pillow to the cool side and once more he was focusing on the meaning of life. Soon after he was in a void. He had waken up not floating above his body but in a darkness so blinding that he could not see his own hands in front of his face. In fact, he had already started to check all his dream indicators and they had all failed the test. The watch on his wrist was ticking, his could not breathe if he held his nose and his index finger did not go through his palm as it usually would. \n\n\"What the heck?!\" - he said out loud reaching to his bedside lamp switch as he assumed he had simply woken up. There was nothing, he was in complete void. Nothing was within reach. In fact, he had just now realized he was floating. There was no floor, no bed, just him. \n\nSuddenly everything around him was bright as day. Blindingly white everywhere. A white so bright he instinctively covered his eyes to soften the pain but it was of no use. His arm could not block the light. Then a figure emerged from the brightness, a human by any definition. He asked the figure: \"Where am I? What is all of this?\". \n\n\"You don't remember?\" - the figure said, the features of whom could still not be discerned due to the light shining from behind it. \n\n\"Remember what exactly?",
        "Dear Elder Brother Ryuji, \n\nI hate you. You don't know how much I've hated you. But these past years, I've had to think about what type of a man would do the things that you did. Do you remember when you stole the last of the medicine money from the cupboard? Do you remember the day our Father died? I know you do. I know I do. \n\nI remember enlisting. And then I remember leaving for the war. You weren't even there to see it. You were gone, drinking without a care in the world. But I'll tell you that our little house was beautiful. The mists; the plain; Mother waving sadly away.... It brings a tear to my eye. \n\nI will never see you again. I am happy. I am going to die -- the ships are closing in. The Americans are coming. I do not love you. And I know that you \n\n\n\nPhillip finished reading the letter for the last time. He had studied Japanese for years, and yet, he had never read something so emotional. The war had taken a toll on both sides, but he had never realized that such tragedy, even before the war, did exist in lives on the other side of the Pacific. \n\nHe wondered. He had the exact address and the name of the receiver as well. Philip looked out over the sea. The island was small, but a wonderful breeze had suddenly come to caress his face. It was a tender moment of nature -- a gift from the world. \n\nShould the intended family receive the letter, Philip knew the damage it would do. When the Americans reached the Japanese mainland, there would be no telling how much pain and suffering there would be. The memory and despair held within one letter would not help ease anyone's pain. \n\nPhillip took out the letter. He knew the last words of the letter.",
        "\"So, I'm not going to remember any of this after I wake up?\" \n\n\"That's correct.\" \n\n\"And I'm not dreaming right now? I'm totally wide awake,\" he said, not quite sure if that last bit was a question or a statement. \n\n\"Sure.\" \n\nThat was a little confusing to him, as the thing hovering over his recliner in the living room was most certainly a nightmare. It had glided through the darkness and around the corner from the hallway only moments prior, a frigid pair of ice blue eyes dug into a pale ceramic head which floated impossibly in the air because it possessed no real body. Instead, its bleached white spine dangled from the base of its skull like a balloon string, a monstrous and only half-human length of bone and yellow sinew which ended in a single venomous barb about as big around as his index finger. He had screamed, he had cried, he had made some mad and very conscious attempt to shit himself because hey, that's what people do, and after several moments in which the abomination simply watched him, he righted himself on the couch and remained stupidly frozen. Perhaps if he didn't move, the creature couldn't see him. \n\nIts name was Harold. \n\nEven now that the thing called Harold had coaxed him into some strange form of polite conversation, he wrangled against the urge to engage in some as yet unexplored and ultimately stereotypical fear-driven response. Maintaining such perfect, unrestrained horror over tea was every bit as exhausting as he never imagined it could be. \n\n\"It's nothing to get too worked up about. I've explored this very scenario a billion different ways in a trillion potential realities all wrapped up in half the time it took for you to stop making a fool of yourself,\" Harold explained. \"You'll come to no harm, although I'm eating your eyes in a neighboring dimension right about now.\" \n\n\"You're.... you what?\" He spoke with all the clarity of a man who had just pulled his head out of an oven. \n\n\"It's how we say hello where I'm from. I consume some vital part of you, and in return you may recite a passage of your choosing from the Ravaged Verse in order to absorb the essence of my infinite will. There is no potential reality in which that makes sense to you, however, so you are most perfectly incapable of common courtesy. No wonder your species is so riddled with such base parasites.\" \n\n\"Puh-p-\" \n\n\"Parasites. Infirmities. Basic and absolutely curable illnesses which your kind just can not seem to transcend. War, lust, ignorance, famine, the DMV.",
        "Once a year comes the day when if you turn eighteen you are given a test. This test would decide on whether you would become a hero, villian, NPC, or monster. My parents had belonged to the hero class and part of the Sock Monkey Guild. Mother had been a Shieldmaiden, Father is a Shinobi. We lost mom a few months ago during the last Troll war. They apparently PM'd each other for months before I was born. \n\nI'm going to be quite clear, my grades have never been what you would call good. In fact I thought I was going to bomb it and be sentenced as a monster. Thing is if you become a monster, you are forever turned into it. Your young would be human until they saw whether or not you too were worthy of it. \n\nFor weeks before my Dad has been grilling me and as I stood in line sandwiched between a guy who smelled extremely like Troll, and my BFF Lori Taylor my mind went blank. \n\nLori has been my BFF since grade two when her family moved here. She saved me half a dozen times, she's also a wiz. I could hear her mutter over and over again. Something to the affect of, \"The Troll rebellion's last any where from 5 months to a year. Three plus five is eight. The current King is Quinten...\" \n\nThe line eeks slowly, this year is a record turn out, even after the test is over we won't know how we did for a week when they post the results in the town square. I wonder to myself how many of these kids will get changed into monsters. I'm almost certain I'll be joining them, at the same time, I want to live up to my parents. \n\n\"Freya Moonstone,\" a blonde lady calls my name, in case you are wondering, I don't know how my parents decided it or if I came with it. \n\n\"Here,\" I call out.

        "The only light in the room came from the single bulb hanging from the ceiling. My handcuffs were chained to the table, my ankles cuffed to the chair, so there was nothing for me to do but wait for my mysterious visitor. The guards had refused to tell me anything about this meeting, except that it was happening. I wasn't given much choice about that. I wasn't given much choice about anything anymore. I almost looked forward to my last meal, because at least then what I wanted would be taken into consideration. \n\nFinally the door opened. Due to the dim light, I couldn't see more than the shadowy forms of the people who entered the room, but I knew two of them well enough. Donovan and McNall, two of the prison's toughest, meanest guards. They stood on either side of the door while the third shadow, the stranger, stepped into the light, taking the form of a man I'd never seen before. He was tall and lean, with close-cut brown hair sprinkled with grey at the temples. He wore a dark, well-tailored suit. \n\n\u201c Diana McFarlane, \u201d he greeted me as he sat across from me. \u201c Convicted of dozens of murders, and sentenced to death. \u201d He leaned across the table towards me. \u201c How would you like to live instead? \u201d \n\nI raised an eyebrow at him. \u201c I figured that offer was off the table. \u201d \n\n\u201c I have a special deal for you, \u201d the man said. \u201c Humanity has been given a rare chance by a certain benefactor\u2014the chance to let all people live free from pain or sadness, save one. That one person will become immortal, but live in misery so that the rest of humanity can be happy. \u201d \n\nI leaned back the fraction of an inch that my bound hands allowed. \u201c How is this possible? \u201d \n\n\u201c I'm afraid I'm not able to explain the how. I am here as a representative of all humankind, to offer you the opportunity of eternal life. \u201d \n\n\u201c And eternal misery, \u201d I said. \n\n\u201c And eternal misery, \u201d he agreed. \n\nI tilted my head to the side. \u201c Why me? \u201d \n\n\u201c Because the people of the world were given a choice, and they decided that if anyone was going to make this sacrifice, it ought to be someone who already has nothing to lose, someone who deserves a life of punishment. Those who have been sentenced to death seemed like the best candidates. I have approached a number of such candidates around the world already, and if any of them had taken the offer, we wouldn't be speaking. If you turn it down as well, I'll move on to the next name on my list. \u201d \n\n\u201c How long do I have to consider? \u201d \n\n\u201c I'm afraid I need an immediate answer. Should you choose to accept the death penalty you've already been condemned to, I'll need to leave right away. There are many out there who are anxious to find a willing participant in this sacrifice, you understand. \u201d \n\n\u201c Eternal misery doesn't sound like much fun, \u201d I mused. \n\n\u201c And death does? \u201d \n\n\u201c Well, that depends on what comes after death. If there's nothing, then, well, I have nothing to look forward to. But if there's any kind of life after death, odds are I'd be headed straight for Hell and eternal misery anyway, so what's the difference? \u201d \n\nThe man folded his hands together. \u201c There may be no difference to you, but a world of difference to the families and friends of your victims. They would no longer have to mourn the losses of their loved ones\u2014loved ones that you, yourself, took away from them. You could be the one to ease their pain. \u201d \n\nI looked down at my hands on the table. \u201c If I cared about that, do you think I would have killed all those people in the first place? \u201d \n\n\u201c I think that if I keep asking, I'll eventually find someone ready to atone. \u201d \n\nI was silent, considering his words. On the one hand, I couldn't imagine a world where no one felt sorrow for the loss of their loved ones. In my experience, sadness sucked, but it made happiness that much more awesome when you could get it. If all you knew was happiness, would you ever really notice how happy you were? \n\nOn the other hand, I could take away pain that I had personally inflicted on so many survivors, and wouldn't that make a better justice than just having my own life taken? If I stayed and was put to death, my victims' families might feel avenged, but they would be happier if I took this deal. I couldn't pretend I didn't feel my guilt. Maybe I could make up for some of my crimes, at least. \n\nI raised my eyes without lifting my head. \u201c I'm your girl. \u201d \n\nThe corner of the man's mouth lifted in a small smile. \u201c You understand that you will not be released from prison? You will live out the rest of your eternal life here.",

        "Was Sally being foolish? Perhaps a little crazy? Maybe. Her volcano flew in the face of a thousand cliches. In fact, just last year, we lifted the ban on a number of forbidden entries. Volcanoes were at the top of the list, followed by ant farms and sea monkeys. \n\nThe ban was put in place for the past ten years because of the sheer number of these textbook projects. For ten years we forced the kids to stretch their imaginations, rather than simply breaking the spines of their science books. \n\nBut, there was Sally, sitting there at her table. The grin on her face was impish, not at all like her usual reserved self. I couldn't believe that this straight-A honor roll student would pursue the most tired and boring of the projects. \n\nAt first, I assumed she was just busy with her studies and came up on the deadline with nothing real to show. It must be a one-off. She dropped the ball but was trying to save face. Certainly, it couldn't be anything else. Only the most uninspired resort to something this basic. \n\nAfter a little rationalization, I decided that it didn't surprise me too much that she would skimp on the effort involved. She had a strong liking for archaeology, and would state time and time again that it was her passion. \n\nSo, maybe science just wasn't her strong suit. \n\nBut that smile... it betrayed something that I should have caught on to. \n\nHer volcano was standard fair quality at first pass. It was about the size of an overturned bucket, paper mache, and possibly spray painted. It had a towel laid longways on the base of it's foot. This was presumably to ensure that any discharge was absorbed rather than dripping onto the floor. \n\nAll the usual diagrams about the various type of volcanoes accompanied it: Shield, Cinder, Composite... boring stuff. Possibly copied directly from the textbook. \n\nThe interior of the volcano was illustrated, and the telltale vinegar sat to her left, a sure sign that she was going to dazzle me by making something \"amazing\" happen. I wondered, as I looked over this chicken-wire monstrosity, whether she had dyed the baking soda held within. What color would I be looking at for thirty seconds as I tried to keep my boredom from showing? \n\n\"Welcome to the world of volcanoes!\" \n\nOh? She was starting her presentation. Well, I guess it was time to pay attention. \n\n\"For eons, man has gazed at these pits of glowing magma with bewilderment! What secret gods and demons dwell within? How can we be safe? And what actions can shield us from the horrors of the earth?\" \n\nWell, if nothing else, it was attention grabbing... \n\n\"We will delve into this question, but first, we will need some volunteers!\" \n\nI looked about, slightly confounded. There was only me judging her table. She wasn't about to get audience participation from people shuffling by. \n\nJust as my face expressed my confusion, she lifted the towel in front of the volcano with a flourish. \n\n\"Behold! The mighty ant colony of Pompeii the Second!\" \n\nI was now looking at a thriving ant colony, meticulously cultivated. The ants were large carpenter ants, nearly an inch long. They were forced to dwell in a small Grecian city of Sally's construction. There was no underground for them, only the detailed houses constructed to emulate an ancient municipality. The city was meticulous, to say the least. \n\n\"Ah! There they are! The citizens of my ant-topia. They worship this mountain every day, not realizing that a shifting of tectonic plates is about to seal their doom!\" \n\nAt this, Sally removed the tablecloth that surrounded the volcano. Below was a cutaway of the tectonics below the volcano. The detail was of the highest quality. \n\nAnd below that was a metal box with a single button and tubes connected to what appeared to be a pressurized tank. \n\nIt was at this moment that I noticed that the city of the ants contained an ocean as well. It was a fish tank, positioned in a way that it was visible from the front of the table, and it was filled with... yes. it had to be. Sea monkeys. \n\nSally plucked an ant from the city as I marveled at the detailed tectonic plates and the labels that described the fault line that was soon to erupt. \n\n\"Will a sacrifice to the gods appease the mighty volcanoes wrath?\" \n\nShe dropped the ant into the cone with a cackle. \n\n\"No!\" \n\nAs she pressed the red button, I watched as the plates separated, and a gush of hot steam flew from the top of the volcano. The sound turned heads and soon people gathered to watch.",
        "Tania stopped stirring the pot of spaghetti sauce. Her light, airy chatter had cut out as well, leaving silence where there should have been a resolution to her anecdote. One of her hands was frozen around the wooden spoon and the other was curled possessively around the base of her swollen belly. Her eyes were fixed on nothing, wide and glassy. Charlie bolted out of his seat. \n\n\"What is it? Is something wrong with the baby?\" He reached his hands to help her but paused, not knowing if this was really his place. \n\nShe gasped then, her face constricting in pain. \"Yes, yes everything is wrong.\" Her voice was strained. \n\nCharlie swallowed thickly. \"You don't think it's uh,\" he licked his lips and whispered,\" a miscarriage.\" What were the signs of miscarriage? What could he do? \n\nTania jerked her head toward him, eyes narrowed. Her voice was hard when she spoke. \"No, Charlie.\" \n\nHe opened his mouth as if to ask something but quickly thought better of it. \n\n\"I just realized that I'm probably going to have to do this alone.\" Her tone softened and her shoulders slumped. Defeated. \n\nTheodore was still overseas. Charlie didn't know much about deployment but he'd assumed that things were wrapping up over there, that his sister would be reunited with her husband long before their baby was born. \n\n\"They don't know where he is, Charlie. I got the call yesterday.\" She slowly sank to the floor, head in hands. \"Theo is missing in action.\" \n\nCharlie thought that maybe a miscarriage would've been easier to deal with at this point. He felt like an idiot searching for the right words. He kneeled next to his sister on the cool tile and wrapped his arm around her shoulders. \n\n\"What am I supposed to do? I haven't painted the nursery, I haven't gotten a crib, I don't even have clothes for the baby. What if its little toes get cold? I can't be a single parent, Charlie.\" Her breathing was coming in ragged, panicked gasps. \n\nCharlier pulled her closer. He would make this better. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nThe next few months Charlie doted on his sister.",
        "I signed back that I couldn't. \n\n\"Go near music,\" she signed back, motioning me to the bass at the edge of the crowd, where I could better feel the vibration. \n\nI didn't like it in here. Everyone too close and stuffy. People moving to the invisible waves, like they had all gone crazy and I was the only one that could see it. Hearing people were weird. \n\n\"Better?\" My date asked, raising her eyebrows for non-manual marker. \n\n\"Yes,\" I knocked on the open air. \n\nSome of the dancers were staring at us now. \n\nI would have been upset if J hadn't smiled. That was her name-sign anyways, just a J near my cheek, like the sign for juice. Her written name was Jenny. \n\nI couldn't think of anything to sign, nervous until she grabbed my hand and pressed it against the pulsating black box. I noticed more people staring, and focused on J instead, watching her as I uncertainly danced along with the other inmates in my own personal insane asylum. \n\nI would rather be home, watching a dubbed movie or reading a book, anything besides this exhibition where I hung like an art-piece for a bunch of slack-jawed yokels to gawk at. I was tempted to leave right now and drive myself home. \n\nUnfortunately J drove, and I hoped beyond hope that it was because she wanted to save me some time finding the place and not that she imagined that I couldn't.",

        "A part of me certainly knew what I should do. I should have offed myself the first moment that I knew. Of course, I'd seen all the movies, read books, everything. I knew what the moral, upstanding citizen should do. But, just like that guy in a zombie movie who gets bit and never tells anyone, I got bit and never did a thing about it. \n\nThe part of me that was sure I would always make the right choice come some difficult decision turned out to be wrong. I mean, I had never quite anticipated this, how could I? On the first day I was terrified, more that I had been mauled than the connotations that it brought with it. By the end of the first week I was still terrified, but more at the responsibility that rode on my shoulders. Of course, I put it off. I said that I would do it later, I had things I had to get in order, people to see, you know, all those excuses people make. Suicide was just too much of a thought for me to actually go through with it. \n\nAnd then, I began to think that maybe suicide wasn't my only option. Surely, since it was so under the radar that meant that there were people like me who didn't go on murderous rampages, otherwise it would hit the news and everybody would know. At least, that's what I liked to tell myself. I knew the real reason, I just didn't like to think about it.",
        "How we both ended up on an elevator in America, I can never be quite sure. It had been years since the war, and the appeal of the states had drawn me from my war-torn home in Warsaw. I had noticed the man briefly before entering the elevator. We were both on the top floor of the skyscraper, looking out over the pristine American city. As the sun finally set, we both exhaled softly and headed toward the elevator doors. \n\nWe both stepped in, and the doors closed us in together. I stayed to one side, as far away from the man as I could. I'd never been keen of tight quarters. He pressed the button for the lobby, and asked me where I was going. I told him we were going to the same place. The small talk continued at a slow and awkward pace. A few words per floor, maybe. The ride down was a long one and he, like myself, seemed to be the quiet type. \n\nThe more he spoke, though, the more eerily familiar his voice sounded. \nHis voice gave me great discomfort, and my claustrophobia began to come on in full effect. Sweating profusely, I darted toward his side of the elevator and as I reached my arm out to tap the button to get me off at the next floor, my sleeve slid up my forearm to reveal a faded \"561340\" tattoo. I quickly shuffled my sleeve back down my forearm and darted off of the elevator onto the random floor. \n\nI looked at the man for the first time face to face. His eyes were widened, aimed at me, but shooting through me and into the distance in a blank stare. \n\nAs the elevator doors closed in those brief fleeting moments, I felt 1942 all over again. The brick walls. The straw beds covered in bodily fluids. A longing for a woman whose ashes were scattered somewhere in Germany.... maybe around the whole world by now. And his eyes. Those god damned eyes, always haunting.... patrolling. I pointed a trembling finger at him just before the doors finally closed.",

I'm aware.\" \n\n\"And you want to meet him?\" Stephanie asked. \n\n\"Yes, ma'am, I do,\" he answered. The boy began coughing.

        "That day I woke up and my new wings were poking into the dark oak headboard. \n\n\u201c What the- \u201d \n\nAlice was gone. Something urgent had obviously called her. Occupational hazards of being the most powerful woman in the free world. I shook my wings. \u201c Very funny, Tara. \u201d My daughter couldn't hear me, but she had obviously stuck them on with some sort of adhesive. I stretched, yawned and tried to pull them off. It hurt like hell. As I was contemplating what sort of punishment to give Tara, Alice walked in. She, too, was sporting a pair of wings, but they were dark as coal. One feather, however, had a white tip. There were massive circles under her eyes, and I got the feeling she had been up all night. \n\n\u201c Did she put the wings on you too? What will she come up with next. This is worse than April Fool's Day when she tried to issue a First Daughter's executive order for tax-free jellybeans. \u201d \n\n\u201c It's not funny, Tim. Everyone has these wings. Everyone. I've gotten frantic calls from across the globe. Suddenly, they just appeared, and no one has any idea what to do with them. \u201d \n\n\u201c You've got to be kidding me. \u201d \n\n\u201c It's a crisis. But my advisors say it's not so bad. Some people have learned to fly. \u201d \n\n\u201c What? This is great! Think of the possibilities! Aerial yoga! Loop-de-loops with the kiddos! Flying races! \u201d \n\nAlice let out a massive sigh. \u201c Tim, this is serious. Biologists are baffled; there's people flying in the streets, criminals are cutting telephone poles, breaking into high-rises. I just came to tell you I'll be in meetings all day. If Tara needs anything, tell her to call Ophelia. \u201d Ophelia was her assistant. \n\n\u201c Is dinner with the Second Lady and the VP still on? \u201d \n\n\u201c We'll see. Oh, and Tim? \u201d \n\n\u201c Yes? \u201d \n\n\u201c We gave the order to drop the bomb on North Korea four hours ago.

        "When I figured it out, that only good things happened to me at the expense of others, I cocooned myself. I rarely got out of the house that I lived alone in. No one to keep me company, no one to hurt. So it was odd that I happened to meet Mr. Moore that day. I generally tried to talk to no-one, but a thought burned through my mind like a freight train - I couldn't avoid knowing it was there. I went and spoke to him and filled in the forms. \n\n6 months later, I was in a cave in a God-forsaken land, fighting a fight for people who didn't want us there, talking into the radio. \n\n\n\"Beachcomber 21 calling in, Beachcomber 21 calling in, target is just in the midst of leaving, can I get a drop directly on my position?\" \n\n\n\"We can drop in 1 minute, Beachcomber, good luck to you\" \n\n\nJust under a minute later the whole cave shook as heavy bombs destroyed my position, along with the regional insurgent leader. He was caught just exiting the caves, killed instantly. I had hung out with him for the last 48 hours, sucking his luck away, hoping that I'd gotten enough to survive the bombings again.",
        "Parched air filled my lungs and I awoke with a start. \n\nThe rough grass and slightly damp soil beneath my bare body seemed just like any other savanna landscape -- other than occasional patches of grass that seemed to flow rather unnaturally -- yet I couldn't shake the ominous feeling washing over me. \n\nIt was then I realised the soil was slightly damp; though not with the fresh wetness of rain or morning dew. It was something that hit much closer to home -- a sickening smell of iron that threatened to engulf my senses. Something was desperately off. Where am I, and why am I here? \n\nAs I slowly regained my senses, I stumbled uncertainly to my feet. Memories started to trickle back, and I vaguely remembered a large pang of pain before losing consciousness. Ah, that's right. I'd been stabbed. The realisation hit me calmer than I would have expected, and a small voice at the back of my head wondered if I was perhaps in heaven. Afterall, there was no reason for me not to be, was there? \n\nI was a good student, who had always been respectful to teachers. My grades were pretty decent, not the top of my class or anything; but definitely on the better spectrum of students. I was a good daughter, too; who had a loving relationship with my parents and my two siblings. Sunday mornings were always dedicated for church, and I had faithfully practiced my religion; above everything else, for the 20 years I had spent on the materialistic world. \n\n\"Welcome, to the new round. A warm welcome to our new arrivals, and I'm glad to see all of our returning players refreshed and ready to go. The game will start in three minutes.\" \n\nA booming voice cut through my thoughts, and left me even more confused than I had been. Players? Game? What kind of weird fantasy world have I been thrown into? My head swarmed with questions, and a creeping feeling of unease left me rather paranoid. If this was what I had been working towards my whole life, then I'd say it wasn't worth all my time devoted towards finding \u2018 true fulfillment'without the need for materialistic goods.",

        "A klaxon shrills throughout the cold metal of my enclosure. I awake, startled, and try to make my conscious brain aware of my surroundings. Where am I? I look around and take in my location. I was sitting on a metal cot, my feet on the floor and my back against the wall, fast asleep. \n\nThere are shoes on my feet. Thick, massive boots. I am wearing a white shirt and orange pants. The floor is a metallic grate that screeches and squawks under my thick boots. The wall in front of me and to my left is a flat white. I reach out to touch it. It is cold. Behind me, the wall bears a similar story. White matte covering cold steel. My only mental salvation lies to my right. The wall mimics the others, but with one crucial difference: a tall door rises up from the center of the floor. There is no window, nor do I see a way to open it. \n\nA second klaxon blares through my habitat, jerking me from my thoughts. What is happening? I stand up and attempt to step toward the door. The boots are heavy. So heavy. My foot lands and I try to pick up my other one. It stays on the ground, immobile. I lose my balance and begin to fall. In an effort to correct myself I try to slide my other foot underneath me. It too is now locked to the floor and I lose my footing. I land hard on my left shoulder, filling it with a sharp pain. It too feels familiar, as if it's happened before a thousand times. \nSuddenly I hear a voice erupt seemingly from nowhere, filling my tiny cabin with a sense of control. \n\n\u201c Prisoner 127! Move back to your cot \u2013 now. \u201d \n\nWho is this? Who is prisoner 127? Is it me? This feels familiar, but wrong\u2026 in an inexplicable way. \n\nThe order is repeated, this time the tone more strict and severe. \n\n\u201c I\u2026 can't! \u201d I reply, helplessly. My feet can't move. \n\n\u201c I will not tell you again, \u201d the voice demands. \n\nI try to regain my stature. To my surprise, the boots now will move as I slide my feet under me. I pick myself up and sit back on my cot, as the voice requests. \n\nWith a sharp, metallic sound my boots once again adhere themselves to the floor. I am stuck. The door opens to my right. I manage to inhale a quick breath of air before three men in dark, unmarked, protective gear and helmets enter the room and grab ahold of me. I wanted to shout, \u201c What the hell are you doing!? \u201d But the wind was knocked from my lungs by one of the assailant's helmets crushing into my chest, pushing my chin toward the ceiling. With my head locked into place by a helmet and my feet magnetically sealed to the ground, the remaining men then grab an arm each. The man in front of my grabs my head and pushes it between my legs, locking it into place under the weight of his body. From there my arms are twisted behind my back and locked together. I hear the sound of zip-ties clicking together, and feel the tightness of them on my wrists. The sound is familiar. \n\nThe two men on my flanks lift me up while the third exits the room. With a quick hand gesture, I feel the floor release my shoes from its metallic grip. He comes back into the room and places a bag over my head. I am escorted from the room. \n\nThe boots are heavy.

May I come in?\" \n\n\"Of course.\" She replied opening the door with a smile. Smiling, of course, because she was about to be 1000 dollars richer. \n\n\"Children, time for lunch!\" She called.

Thraxxich stood at the doorway. \n\n\"The procedure doesn't hurt, right?\" The matron asked, suddenly worried. \n\n\"Not physically.\" \n\n\"What do you-\" the matron started, but was interrupted by the transformation. In Thraxxich's place, a creature with 9 slimy tentacles and a mouth with rows and rows of teeth reared up, towering over the children. The sound of 20 screams was not enough to drown out the ear-splitting roar the monster produced. The monster slowly recorded the kid's reactions, along with the matron, who screamed until she passed out from fear.",
        "\"Here's the thing my boy is challenged,\" I stare out the window at the blue day. I know this man is going to pay me so I attend to play around a bit smell the clouds find the clown face round the spaces of sky them oh look, I see it it looks like Ronald mcdonald. \n\n\"Challanged?\" I say now paying full attention. What am I setting myself up to who is this kid exactly. What am I in for? \n\n\"I.C, imagination challenged got it, this is why your here, I'm giving you money to watch my kid play with him pretend to be his imaginary friend you a actor you can drizzle just a bit of play into him, I'm counting on you to make it happen. \n\n\"Got it boss. \"I replied staring at his unusual nose and then the back of the hallway.\" \n\n\"Hes right inside his bedroom right there just go in as soon as you came out with fun unlocked in boys hands, I will give you the money.\" \n\nI opened the boys wooden door slowly it creaked and I backed away but then slid the unusual door open. \n\nThe room was grey and tidy with no child art on the walls it was just empty and wrong all I could think was to say get out, get out. But I couldn't run I had to stay in order to pocket the cash. \n\nHe sat there with desperately needing someone to make his day he was small and crumpled like a paper ball on the ground. \n\nI reached out my hand and grabbed the sun.",
        "It all lined up so perfectly. The prophecy of the Al'tiine, the blind man who only spoke to me in riddles and gave me the secret to closing the portal, and the fact that I was one of the seven who could hear the whisperings of the Night Shadows and was actually in place to stop their invasion from the ninth dimension. \n\nI bled, suffered, and killed to make it to the center of the forgotten desert before the gateway opened fully, despite the fact that the Others had caused the world to go silent. It's true that some people offered me assistance, but it was never to accompany me, only trinkets to ease their guilt. I had to walk the dark path of Malgorga alone. I questioned whether I would leave with my sanity. \n\nBut, I didn't give up because deep down, I knew that I was the chosen one. I knew that I was special and that I had finally found my true purpose in the world, and it was to be the one true savior of existence. The world would come together to celebrate me. Statues would be built in my likeness, and mother's would name their children after me for generations. I was going to be remembered as a near god for countless generations. \n\nIt was thoughts like these that kept me going right through to the end where I managed to find and exploit the weakness in the unearthly, ashen grey behemoth guarded the portal. I chanted the spell that the blind man had given me, over and over, and I watched the portal slowly close. I could feel all of the hatred of the Elders of the Night Shadows bath over me, and I knew that it was all at an end and I had saved everyone, and then.... \n\nEverything went black, and I started to tumble through darkness. I almost lost who I was as a person, and while I struggled to understand what was happening, I heard a booming voice saying, \"Game Over\". What game? What was over, I had saved everything, what was happening? \n\nThe voice boomed again in the blackness, \"Insert More Tokens.\" I heard the shrill sounds of falling metal, and I suddenly my fall was stopped, and I was on my feet. I looked around and realized that I was back in my home, right were it had all started, and that it looked exactly as it had before the raid; all the damage was gone.",
        "My father was standing on the balcony when I found him, silhouetted by the setting sun. His vestments were strewn across a chair and he had a drink in his hand. He sipped thoughtfully as he looked down across the bay where the fleet lay at anchor, the royal crest flapping in the breeze. \n\n\u201c Father? \u201d I ventured, quietly. He never was a particularly sociable man, and I hated interrupting him when he was in one of his moods. To my surprise I was met with a silence that stretched out between us instead of the usual bitter recriminations or cutting remarks. \n\n\u201c Yes, son? \u201d He asked after a while, not turning to look back at me. His shadow stretched across the floor, a silent affirmation of the presence of the man who held the lives of millions in his hands. I was still trying to sort out what I was going to say when he continued, \u201c Your brother is dead. His party was ambushed on their way to the front. They delivered his head to me in a box. \u201d Anything else that I had thought to say slipped out of my head immediately. \n\n\u201c He\u2026 \u201d \n\n\u201c Is dead, yes, please listen when I am speaking. \u201d My father sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201c I apologize, I am\u2026 distraught. \u201d I must admit I was rather taken aback, my father had never once apologized to me in the twenty or so odd years I had known him. As he turned to me I was suddenly struck by how old he seemed, an eternity of sorrows etched into the creases of his face. \u201c I have sat on this throne for thirty one years, son. And what have I done in all that time? I ignored the teachings of my own father, believing that the might of our kingdom was unstoppable. When I think back to the days of my youth I feel such foolishness. There is always more to learn, son. Even after all this time. \u201d \n\nI tried to stammer a response but I was still being crushed under the enormity of his simple proclamation. He continued on, \u201c And now look what I have done. The son I groomed and taught all the ways of warfare and rule is dead. Killed in an instant by a lucky pack of scavengers. I have ignored you for too long, I fear. Perhaps I saw in you too much of myself. Your brother was very much like my father, you see. Cunning, ruthless, with a keen eye for strategy. \u201d \n\n\u201c But he was the heir, sir. \u201d I said, and through a haze of disbelief I remembered my brother's wife. \u201c His marriage has already been consummated, surely- \u201c \n\n\u201c His wife bears no child. \u201d He interrupted immediately. \u201c And as the eldest living male descendent of my house, the throne falls to you. It will be a difficult road, my son, and we have so little time. Perhaps I will come to realize that you will be a greater ruler than even your brother might have been. \u201d \n\nI had never considered or even made pretensions to the throne; it had always been my brother's birthright. But standing in my father's quarters with the sea winds blowing in and the last sunset of summer sinking below the horizon, I could almost see myself there. \u201c I will endeavor to do my best, father. \u201d \n\n\u201c Here is your first lesson: be ever vigilant. Across the sea there are many that would come to our shores and kill our people for wealth and enrichment. To the north and east enemies press in, looting villages and killing as they go. \u201d He took a long draught and set his empty glass on the railing. \u201c They call us monsters, son. And you must be ready. \u201d",
        "He looked up at me, blood dripping from his bruised knuckles. His eyes burned with something I had seen in those who served me with unquestioning devotion: pure rage. \n\nHe had been a good servant, and an even better mage. If he had been given a few more years, perhaps he could have amounted to something. \n\nAlas, there he lay. His once fair face mutilated and smashed by the raw strength of this supposed hero and his newfound power. He rose from the marble floor and sent the limp body flying toward me, missing left. \n\n\"So this is the price you would pay to defeat me? Sacrificing your friends and drinking the cursed blood? You know that even if you do manage to kill me and succeed in purging this from your body, your bloodline is tainted. You will never have offspring. The line of kings dies with you.\" \n\nHe slowly advanced on the throne. With ragged and heavy breaths, he slowly spoke \"I.... DO N'T.... CARE! YOU AND ALL YOU HOLD DEAR WILL BURN AS I DO\". \n\nAlready I could see his veins pulsing red, his eyes turning to midnight. The demonic ichor he had ingested was consuming him.",
        "Cyrus sat near the fire, his eyes closed as if in deep thought. Athene looked at him, wondering what in the name of the gods the fair-haired healer could be thinking of. \n\n\"He's still meditating?\" Grao sat next to Athene, two freshly killed rabbits in his hand. \n\n\"I think he fell asleep.\" Athene rolled his eyes and put down the stick he'd been using to poke the fire. \n\nIt had been two months since the three joined forces. Well, since Cyrus joined to be more precise. Their most recent mission was to capture at least three Black Dragoons for a certain hotheaded blacksmith in town. Athene wasn't exactly friendly with Cyrus, but he wasn't exactly hostile either. \n\n\"I can hear you.\" Cyrus opened one eye and looked at the young red-head. \n\nIf one needed further proof the blacksmith and Athene were mother and son, their temper was certainly said proof. A **glance** had set of Athene's nerves and he was already a few yards away when Grao finally noticed. As expected of a little thief. \n\nAnger soon turned to panic as an arrow lodged itself in a tree just inches from Athene's face. Three more arrows followed, and Athene ran. He wasn't sure if he was heading to the others. He reached for hia dagger, only to find it was not there. \n\n*By the fire.... * He remembered setting it down, but not picking it up. He swore under his breathe and tried to remember the path he took after so childishly stomping away. \n\nAn arrow hit Athene right in the shoulder. It only slowed him down, but it was just enough for Athene to see a flash of steel aimed right for his head. \n\nHe closed his eyes and dived for the ground. Or rather, he was pushed. Athene looked up and saw a familiar figure in pale white and blue clothes. The green eyes that had somehow angered Athene earlier were now intensely focused on the bandit in front of them. \n\nCyrus had a steel wire wrapped around the bandit's wrist. With one pull, the bandit lost a hand. \n\nBlood was practically pouring out the stump, and Athene was still in shock. What Cyrus did next added to it.",
        "\"it's finally been a hundred years for the people of Earth,\" spoke the great alien general to his command room, their'mother ship' surrounded by a fleet of a hundred thousand ships, each with the capabilities to destroy a city from high orbit. \"We, the greatest wagers of war in the Universe, ride towards the unknown. It is almost thrilling.... how I have missed this feeling.\" \n\n\n\"We're coming out of the wormhole, General. No signs of any defences on the perimeter of the system.\" \n\n\nThe general flicked their long green tongue in distaste. \"Perhaps I gave them too little time. This won't be much of a challenge.\" The fleet of ships entered the system of Earth, the main force holding steady before the field of asteroids which was thought to be a prime defensive position that the Earthlings could reach by now. \n\n\nHours were spent sending scouts and gathering information on the system to see how far along the Earthlings had progressed, but they found nothing. Even system wide scans of technology or cloaking systems were turning up negative.... for a moment, the general felt a chill run down his spine. Had the Earthlings learned of a way to hide their technology? It felt like a challenge, and one that the great general couldn't resist. Perhaps he was being too optimistic about the potential of the Human race. \n\n\n\"Move our most advanced scouts towards the known flight path of earth. Send two.... no, three. Losses will be acceptable.\" \n\n\nSeveral hours later one of the scouts reported in to the mother ship after landing on Earth, giving a live video feed as they strolled casually through a city street. \"General, no one is here. We haven't seen an Earthling since we landed. Scout 45 reports the same. The buildings look like they've been abandoned for years.\" \n\n\n\"Not a single Earthling? Not a hint of resistance? What's going on down there?\" \n\n\nThe scout paused, flipping through a small booklet with a picture of a large airship on the front. The general's eyes were glued to the booklet, satisfied in knowing the Earthlings at least attempted to make larger space-faring ships.... though puzzled at how they hadn't found any.",
        "An Atlantic Exclusive \n\nAn excerpt from \nFalling Forward: The Memoirs of President Mike Paulatowski. \n\nLet's be honest, I had no business being elected president. You know it and I know it. Pundits may refer to me as the Social Media President or the first populist president of the 21st century but in truth I was the first person to be upvoted to the Presidency. \n\nWhat brought us here? \n\"Mike Paulatowski needs you motherfuckers to vote!\" \n\nThe gag was simple enough. I gave a profanity laden address to an 8th grade school assembly, with a megaphone, demanding that \"you motherfuckers need to vote for me, cause I will CLEAN - SHIT - UP!\" I think the real thing that took it viral was the reaction of the kids. They thought it was hilarious. A grown man acting like a crazy person and trying to get elected to be the class president. They got the joke, the rest of you clearly did not. \n\nAnd then came the follow up videos. They were a hit and I was famous. Everything was cool. \n\nSoon reddit got a hold of it and sexybeeffarts45 started that god damned write in campaign. At the time I was foolish and just ran with it. And then there I was getting sworn in. \n\nA lot of so-called political professionals like to say that there was a simplicity to the message of \"cleaning shit up\" or that I captured the Zeitgeist. Those people are full of shit. Americans were just fed up with a political system that wasn't working for them anymore and decided to send a clown to DC. Too bad we got rid of the electoral college, that could've prevented this sort of thing from happening. \n\nMy dad always told me winners never quit and quitters never win but he never said anything about getting fired. And Lord knows I tried. \n\nFirst I used the provisions of the Patriot Act II to declare war on Canada. I figured nobody would want to go to war with Canada because they're so nice. I figured wrong. Oil companies thought it was a fantastic idea. It was a short war. Nine days. The price of oil plummeted and the economy grew by double-digit percentages. \n\nNext I decided to make an ass of myself at my first state of the Union address. I gave a three word speech. \"Fuck All Y'all\". Overnight my approval rating jumped 15 points. They called it \"refreshing\". \n\nWith nothing working, I concluded that I would have to come up with something that everyone would agree was horrifying. The end of social security. Who could possibly support this? I did succeed in trashing my approval ratings at first.",

        "I momentarily lose grip of the steering wheel as the truck bounces on the dirt track, before quickly tightening my grip and continuing forward with the headlights blaring ahead of me. I chuckle to myself thinking, two fucking tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, and this is the shit I'm doing? Using the skills I was trained to use for the'greater good' against low life street thugs who've gotten on the wrong side of the wrong people? Pfft,'Pays good' I say to myself as I throw my cigarette out the window, seeing the truck ahead in the distance, waiting ominously in the field. \n\nI hear whoever this guy is in the truck moving about, attempting to cry for help with the duct tape over his mouth, \n\n\"ITS NO USE KID, STOP STRUGGLING, IT'LL BE DONE SOON\" I shout back to him. \n\nThey always do struggle I think to myself, survival and fear is a powerful cocktail when somebody realises they might not live to see tomorrow. I flash the headlights on and off twice as I always do, and whoever this thug is does the same. Just a precaution in case some hillbillies driving around at this time and mistakes this truck as someone who needs help, I chuckle to myself, now THAT would be a worst case scenario for a do-gooder. \n\nAs the truck slows to a halt, I open the door and hop out to light up another smoke, letting the sweet taste of Marlboro Red consume my lungs to help calm me down, it always has, and always will. \n\n\"YOU READY?\" the man shouts from the other truck. \n\n\"Hang on\" I shout back before taking another pull of the smoke, \"Just needa get my gun\". \n\nI open the glove compartment and voila, once again, same weapons been left in this stolen car for me, a specialised Glock with a suppressor, whoever wants this guy in the back dead must want him gone bad to have paid someone to steal this truck, kidnap this guy and give me this gun, doesn't matter to me who it is anyways, never has and never will. \n\nI open the trunk to sit this skinny looking fuck with a duffel bag over his head shaking, with the smell of urine suggesting to me he's pissed his pants, I hate it when they do that, cant stand the smell. I grab the guy by his neck and hoist him out, he doesn't seem to be struggling as much, just paralysed with fear I suppose, who wouldn't be, everyone's seen the movies, everyone knows the score. \n\n\"Signal out here is fucking awful right?\" says the thug as I throw the kid to the floor just outside the unmarked grave. \n\nI check mine, no bars. \"Agreed\" I say, ending the conversation quickly, they never do last long with these kinda guys anyways. \n\n\"Take off the bag and duct tape for the picture, I got ta take a quick piss\" I say to the thug, who nods back slowly as I run behind the truck and start peeing quickly, wanting to get out of this eerily quiet field and go find a cheap hooker back in town. \n\nI come back around and everythings off the kids head, and hes looking down at the floor with his.... oddly familiar brown hair.... no, you're not thinking straight, time to get this over with. \n\n\"Look up to the camera now\" I said sternly, I take out my phone once again and go to the camera, focused on it to load so I can take this picture. \n\n\"Tommy....tommy WHAT THE FUCK, TOMMY WHAT ARE YOU DOING\" the kid says, but this ain't no kid, this is Jonathan.",
        "I'd read about them.... The Otherlanders. What a nice story it had been. A man lost in between reality and technology who is stalked by a large short rotund and an eerily tall elegant thin. How nice this story is I had mused, what creativity it brings. \n\nThe story never left me though. Some thing about it became pegged to the back of my brain. Sitting there. Watching. I went back to my normal life, but some part of me stayed aware. I didn't realize it until the second or third time. \"Oh hey, look at that fat little man and that tall skinny man, that reminds me of the otherlanders\" I had been so ignorant. It continued though. Everywhere I went I began to notice their embodiment. In women, men, couples, creatures, but never acquaintances.... I never recognized them. Just their size relation. I'd never re - see them after I stole a glance, but they would return.

        "His eyes shot open and he sat up with a jolt. He had no idea why, it was just some sort of.... Instinct. He glanced around, confused. He had no idea where he was.... It was his room for sure, but at the same time, it wasn't. It wasn't the bare white walls lacking decoration with the mess of gaming consoles, controllers and miscellaneous wires as usual, his eyes were met with a much softer sight. Surprisingly familiar, even.... He could hear the rustling of the trees outside as the temperate wind lazily brushed through the leaves of the tree just outside, golden shafts of light shimmering into the room through the open blinds, wonderfully illuminating the flowered wallpaper adorning each of the walls. His childhood home.... He knew it had to be.... After all, this wallpaper wasn't any normal wallpaper, his mother made it herself! He had vague, yet fond memories of watching her cheerily paint each individual flower when he was just a few years old. A far better time that was, before all of the non-fatal, yet crippling diseases that life apparently thought his parents deserved, and all the financial troubles that came from said diseases.... He slowly stood up, glancing down at the plush carpet beneath his feet, and even wriggling his toes slightly just for the sake of getting a better feel for the softness of it. After taking a quick glance around to better appreciate the beauty of the room, he made his way over to the window, pulling up the blinds and looking outside. He had to raise a hand to block the sun, it was clearly very early in the morning, likely under an hour after dawn, and the sun was casting a gorgeous golding glow over the wonderfully familiar suburban neighborhood that stood just outside. Part of him wanted to wake himself up to make sure this was actually a dream, part of him wanted to try and manipulate this dream, and part of him even tried to tell himself that there was something wrong here, that no dream should be this vivid.

        "\u201c The first law of Quantum Economics is that currency doesn't exist until it's observed. But how can that be, you might ask? How can money be observed if it doesn't exist until the moment of observation? Well, that's difficult to explain precisely, but at any given moment there is the potential for the generation of funds spontaneously out of the quantum foam. \u201d \n\n\u201c But sir, if money can be generated spontaneously, then why isn't it constantly appearing everywhere? \u201d \n\n\u201c That's a good question, Jennifer, and it leads us to the second law of Quantum Economics. Currency is generated and lost in reverse proportion to your awareness of it. This is why a bank account constantly monitored hemorrhages money, and why money always seems to find its way into your couch, where you're least expecting it. \u201d \n\n\u201c So are you saying we could just ignore our bank accounts and have infinite money? \u201d \n\n\u201c Ah yes, the obvious question. It would seem that way at first glance, but how many of you could really do that? Could you stop yourself from guessing, from wondering how much was left? Everyone knows how much money they have, except for the super rich, and they have their own problems. \u201d \n\n\u201c What kind of problems, sir? \u201d \n\n\u201c Quantum Tax. Matter can neither be created nor destroyed, remember? The energy to generate currency has to come from somewhere. Ever wonder why the rich are never happy? \u201d \n\n\u201c Are you saying that money is generated out of happiness? \u201d \n\n\u201c Well, sometimes. Emotions generate the energy we use to interact with the world. I mean, think about it, how much does apathy ever accomplish? The potential energy of a life filled with emotion is transmuted into the currency we use every day. But the sad truth is, in such conversions, energy is always lost. Any attempt to replace the lost emotions with currency will always fail. \u201d \n\n\u201c So are you saying money is a useless drain on us? \u201d \n\n\u201c A drain? Certainly. Useless, not necessarily.",

Faraz, I need your help.\" \n\n\"W-what is it, sir?\" \n\n\"Faraz I sense there's another Path in this room. Do you sense him? No, of course not, you're still young.",

Her eyes betrayed her exhaustion as she posted her ad. \n\n\"For sale: Baby shoes, never worn.\" \n\nShe struggled out of her chair and waddled into the bathroom. Carelessly, she turned the faucet knobs filling the bathtub with warm water. Jessica took off her wedding ring and opened the medicine cabinet, setting her ring on top of a bottle of prenatal vitamins as she revealed her hidden stash of cigarettes she's been hiding from her husband. \n\nShe had everything she needed in this bathroom to enjoy her last cigarette.

        "It was like nothing I'd ever seen - wind ripped branches from trees and shingles from the roof tops, throwing them *clattering* to the street like some mid-tantrum child. That's when the Layton's house caught fire. \n\nPoor man, he'd bought it only a year ago, and the agent hadn't even told him what happened to the previous tenant. What a mess. \n\nTo his credit, Layton was always yelling at the Davies' to keep their trees trimmed, but Andrew Davies wasn't much of a doer. By the time the fire department arrived, the whole south side of the street was painted in flames - my house included. There were clouds of smoke hanging above my bed. When I looked out of the window, I could see red and gold shadows dancing everywhere. \n\nI guess I was still a bit sleepy, because I don't remember how I ended up downstairs. \n\nThere was a crowd standing in front of the Davies' house. Andrew carried out his daughter, her head hanging limp over his thick, sweaty arms. I stepped forward to help him, but the firefighters were yelling at everyone to stay back. \n\nIn the back of the crowd, a man was chuckling. His ears were dirty, his brow was smudged with dirt - it was hard to see a single point on his body that looked like it wasn't covered in dirt. I couldn't put a name to the face, but I had no problem giving him a stern look. \n\nMy eye caught his, and the grin slid from his mouth. I turned back to the houses, listening to the crackle of burning timbers. A fresh wave of, I'm afraid to say, an almost *comfortable* heat rolled over me. For a brief moment, I thought about stepping closer to the blaze, until another fireman walked out- \n\nOut of *my* house. \n\nHe had a woman over his shoulder. He was running. He was breathing and hacking up smoke like a pipe furnace. She wasn't breathing much at all. \n\n\u201c Hehehe- \u201d I heard a stifled giggle from the man. \n\n\u201c What is *wrong* with you? \u201d I whispered to him, \u201c Can't you see how serious this is? \u201d \n\n\u201c I can see just fine, thank you! \u201d he chirped, \u201c But can *you? * \u201d \n\n\u201c What on *Earth* are you talking about? \u201d I said, giving him what I hoped was a hard stare. His face was purple and blue in the flame-light. At least, I assumed it was the flame-light that colored him so. I couldn't quite figure out who he was, but I was *sure* I had seen him before. \n\nHe smiled, and with my brow creased as far as it could crease, I asked, \u201c Have we met? \u201d \n\n\u201c Yes, we have. And unfortunately, we are meeting again. \u201d \n\n*Well, that's just rude, * I thought. I gave him a proper harumph, and turned my back. \n\nHe didn't seem to get the hint. He pointed over my shoulder, at the fireman carrying the woman from my house, \u201c Don't you know that woman? \u201d \n\nThere was a taunting lilt to his voice, and I could hear the laughter creeping back in. \n\n\u201c No, \u201d I said, \u201c It must be one of the neighbors.",
        "The Ballad of Mona Lisa by Panic! At The Disco \n___ \nMarilyn sat in the corner of the room, sunk into a red paisley armchair, painting her fingernails a deep burgundy that flirted with black. Each stroke of the brush was deliberate and intense, the glossy handle flashing in the low light that glinted off her teeth. Morgan watched from the bed, unsure of why she'd be smiling. He glanced about the room, counting three empty bottles of gin and a few more half empty. \n\n*What have I gotten myself into? * he asks himself. \n\n\"Shall we go?\" Marilyn asked from the corner, interrupting his dark thoughts. \"I'm ready to go.\" \n\n\"Let's go, then,\" He answered. \n\nThey took a car, sleek and black, to the ball. Morgan showed the forged invitation, his tie feeling like a snake tightening around his neck until the bouncer nodded and said \"Welcome, Mr. Strumford, enjoy the evening.\" \n\nMarilyn divorced herself from his arm as soon as they met the crowd, and disappeared. \"I'm going to powder my nose,\" she had said. Ha. Marilyn didn't even wear makeup most nights, and even then it was only lipstick and eye shadow. Still, she outshone every other woman in the room. If they were diamonds, then she was the moon, rarer and more precious than all of them put together. \n\nHe wandered to a circle of revelers, holding glasses of champagne in their perfect hands and making small talk amongst themselves. They parted to let him join, and Morgan became acutely aware that he was out of his depth here. \n\nHe was a businessman of sorts, dealing in small crimes and information. Enough to afford him a taste of the finer things, but never truly sink his teeth. These were the men who lazed, stuffed on caviar and cocaine in homes he couldn't afford to walk past, and yet Morgan was going to con them. \n\n\"Who might you be?\" asked the leader, tall and blonde with a perfect part and dazzling smile. Gianiss, a mob man and owner of two casinos. \n\nMorgan paused, remembering what Marilyn had told him. *Lie all you want, lie every word, but never give them enough to know who you are. Better known as a pretender than a thief. * \n\n\"I'm new in town, off the trains just a month ago. Looking to expand an empire.\" \n\n\"What sort of empire?\" Gianiss inquired. \n\n\"One I'm not ready to discuss in pleasant company,\" Morgan answered. \n\n\"Well, here's a bigshot. What do you think, fellas? Should we introduce ourselves to Mr...\" the question was heavy. If Morgan used one of his usual pseudonyms, there was a chance he'd be found. A name that they'd heard before, and he'd be quizzed on connections. What had Marilyn said? \n\n\"Stanford, no relation.\" \n\nThey welcomed him, then. They found a table and talked shop, staring at the beautiful women who walked past, pretending not to notice a table of rising mobsters and businessmen. \n\n\"Are any of them yours?\" Morgan asked Gianiss. \n\n\"I took it you had your own working girls, Stanford.\" \n\n\"For men of baser taste, absolutely. But you employ women for the likes of us, don't you?\" \n\nGianiss threw his head back and laughed. \"I guess no man comes to sin city to live a pious life, but I had hoped you were an exception.\" \n\n\"There's nothing wrong with just a taste of what you've paid for.\" \n\nGianiss whistled with his fingers, and three women approached the table. \n\nMorgan kissed the hand of one with auburn hair and green eyes. \"What plans do you have for tonight, Miss?\" \n\nShe smiled, slightly too wide and whispered into his ear. Morgan blushed and rose from the table. \"I think I'll take my leave, gentlemen. It was great to meet you.\" \n\nShe lead him from the table and up the grand staircase. The party below went on.",

        "They say that if you've been forgiven for all your sins, when you die, you go to Heaven. Once there, you talk to the man upstairs aka God. \n\nWell what if God came down to you? \n\nI've worked for the NYPD for 15 years now and have solved countless crimes. From muggings in alleys to drunk barhoppers peeing on statues- I am the first detective mentioned when a crime happens. \n\nI woke up on a bright Sunday morning. The sun was high up and life just seemed good. My cup of Joe was hot. The radio was playing my favorite tunes. I was ready to take on the day. \n\nWhen I got into work, my task was hand written and laid on my desk. \n\nThe note read: \"Multiple religious scholars around the world have visions and dreams that God has left his post in Heaven to roam the Earth alongside humanity, making his temporary home in New York City. Track down the Almighty one and expose Him.\" \n\nWhat was strange is that the note was not addressed to me or anyone like our tasks usually are; it was only signed in illegible handwriting. \n\nI left the office and walked to the first place I expected to find God- church. I walked into the chapel and saw rows and rows of ordinary people, bowing their heads and praying. But there was no God, at least not in physical form. I left the church and walked down the street. \n\nMaybe God was in an alleyway feeding stray cats or helping cure an alcoholic? \n\nNothing. \n\nI kept searching. I tried to pick up on supernatural hints that the Lord was upon us. \n\nNothing. \n\nI decided to test my luck in the most unholy place I could think of; maybe God decided he needed to pay a visit. I walked down the sidewalk and down a flight of stairs. I was in the New York Subway Station. \n\nI purchased a ticket and walked to the boarding platform. It was dark in the tunnels and the people around me were still as hopeless as they had always been. It seemed like there was no holy touch here.... \n\nuntil a bright light appeared down the tracks.",
        "Humanity is an unremarkable species according to practically every single member of the Allied Planets. They weren't physically remarkable, their intelligence was just sufficient to have them classified as average, and they shared no unusual trait or talents that were of benefit of anyone. When first contact was made with them by the Hoto there were many who wondered if it was even worth the time to open formal relations. As such only the Hoto interacted with the humans on any regular basis, feeling that since they were the ones to show them that they were not alone in the galaxy, the last thing they wanted was to abandon them. \n\nNo one could imagine how this seemingly benign alliance would forever affect the galaxy. When a deposit of rare tililium was discovered on a remote Hoto colony near the Xig alliance, conflict erupted as the Xigs laid claim to the planet to control the tililium. The fighting was fierce, the Hotos were advance but where a single Hotian ship could contend against five Xigian, the Xigs had twenty times the numbers. The Hotos sought help from the Allied Planets, but the loss of a single colony was declared more desirable to the prospect of war. Humanity were the only ones to answer the call to arms. Though their military was no where near the strength of the Hotos, they would not abandon their friends. \n\nThe war was devastating, although as expected the Xigs were able to continue their conquest of Hotian space. It wasn't long before they had even conquered Hoton, the small white marble of snow and ice the Hotos called home. It was then that they turned their attention to Earth. Ignored throughout the conflict for it's insignificance, it was the only planet to accept the Hotian refugees and remained the final bastion of resistance. As expected the sol system defenses were easily defeated by the superior Xigs and the fleet entered Earth's orbit as conquers. The Xigs expected this to be their day of victory, the Hotos however remember it as the day the phrase \"Never push the pink-skins to the thin ice\" was first uttered. \n\nWhat humanity lacked in abilities compared to the other races in the galaxy they more than made up for in their tenacity. When the first Hotos refugees arrived at Earth they immediately set to work to help the earthlings strengthen their defenses.",
        "\"You realize what this means, don't you?\" A shadowy figure spoke from its perch ten feet above Commander Uzyk. \"Humanity at large is losing hope. The outer walls of the Sanctum fell last month, and even the citadel can not hope to survive long. And with this news -\" \n\n\"I acknowledge that the situation is dire,\" she replied, \"but -\" \n\n\"No. There is no other alternative. When the existence of life itself is threatened, those with the means to act must do so.\" \n\n\"Who said that? Hitler?\" \n\n\"Who?\" \n\n\"Sorry. I used to read the ancient histories.\" She shuddered as an explosion far away rocked the ground underneath her. Crates of food and weapons crashed to the ground, and the failing fluorescent lights flickered a few times more. \"Listen, the Council will never stand for your solution. And neither will I. We will fight to the death, but we won't sacrifice our principles.\" \n\nThe shapeless form laughed harshly. \"You think your moral stand will be remembered for all of time. But who will do the remembering?\" It leaped from outcropping in the wall and stood next to her, still no more solid. \"I will do this with or without your approval. Do not get in my way.\" \n\nIt strode to a small door in the wall, and began pressing buttons on an keypad. As it did so, Uzyk scrabbled around on the floor, at last grasping a discarded bottle of some substance. She turned it over and read the date: 10/02/151441. \"It reads today,\" she spat. \"This is the last one. Our final hope. It's dead and gone. As are we all.\" \n\nThe darkness turned towards her for a moment, and it seemed to almost pity her, before pressing a final button. The door swung open, revealing -- \n\nA storeroom packed with thousands of containers labeled \"Corn Syrup.\" \n\nUzyk gasped and fell to her knees. Shaking, she drew a gun from her belt and aimed it unsteadily at the blackness. \"You have doomed us all,\" she murmured. \n\n\"It is time to embrace the new way, Commander. No longer can Maple Syrup sustain us.",

        "There was once a man, he said that if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you. So I gazed into the marble as if it was the abyss. I could only look at it from afar as every other curious observer did. But it never gazed at me back, could it be there were too many others so it would gaze at me? I was not special, surely I was not, and only the special could take a closer look. There were even other, so special, the chosen they called them. Not very intricate name if you ask me, but the name very descriptive as they were indeed chosen. No one did know how and why the chosen were chosen, but they were and that was all that mattered. I would visit the marble every evening after work, like it was my dear friend. My dearest friend, it who would not even look at me. But I looked at it, and that was enough. I once felt, I think I did. It looked at me, for the shortest of times it looked at me. That night I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat the day after not until I saw it again. The marble, nothing special about it, but had you did place any other in its place, I would know, they would know. We all would know. The time passed, but the marble never looked at me again. I was never special, I was never chosen, but I was old. So much time I've spent looking at it, only one look it gave back. My last days were near, I felt it deep down I think even the marble felt it. I went to see it one last time. Too see the marble that looked at me once. One last gaze I gave it and I turned my back. I walked slowly again, and then I heard the noise. The sound of the marble hitting the ground resonated, everyone was quiet in an instant. The sound that made the silence. Then I saw it, slowly rolling towards me. It stopped at my feet, I noticed my worn off shoes, it must have been a long time since I got a new pair. I picked up the marble, gently, holding back the tears. My whole life I waited for that. I squeezed the marble and I closed my eyes. Is that what happiness feels like?",
        "\"Dude, Freja's going to kill you,\" Heimdall called over the open air wave. He'd been searching for hours and Loki was nowhere to be found. \"Odin forbid, Loki, you know I don't have time for this horse shit, she needs that necklace!\" \n\nCackling answered him over the intercom, \"I know! She's never gon na get to the Asgard on time!\" Loki's laughter was tattooing itself against Heim's ears. \n\nHeimdall's ship was equipped with the best perception filters white light could produce, but fuck it if Loki didn't have a way around EVERYFUCKINGTHING. He had skirted the Baltic and was heading toward the open Atlantic when an idea sprung to mind. \n\n\"Fuckit,\" he called, plunging into the ocean. If there was one thing Loki didn't know how to modulate, it was aquatic frequencies. He brought up the outer shield menu and scrolled through the local fauna, \"No, no, fuck no, what's that? Seal, perfect,\" he said, highlighting the grey little water dog. He slid the ship onto a rock, setting the behavioral circuits to'Lounge'. \n\nIf he was lucky, the excess water would fuck with the Trickster's sensors long enough to...... \n\nA fly began to zip out across the water, stopping a thousand feet offshore from where Heimdall sat. \"Clever little bitch,\" he sighed. He tended to exclude insects from the ships filters, too many of the little shits to keep track of constantly. He began to monitor the airwaves, waiting for...... \n\n\"Dumbass,\" Heimdall could hear the smile spread across Loki's lips as he sighed his usual signoff, and no sweeter pleasure could be had than when he hit the fly with a frequency jammer. The ship burst to it's proper size, throwing the inhabitant all ajumble, \"Sonofabitch!\" \n\nIt was Heimdall's turn to smile a deliciously vengeful smile, snapping the energy locks on the engines. \"Give it, jackass. She needs the apple or the atmosphere is going to kill her.\" \n\nLoki was pouting, still slumped haphazardly against a wall, \"Did I say you could come on board?\" \n\n\"Cut the shit.\" \n\n\"You really think I would have let her die?\" A false masque of horror and heartbreak spread across his face. He slid the wroght gold and crystal necklace from an inside pocket and tossed it at the Watchman. \n\n\"I think you're jackass enough to try,\" Heimdall curled his nose at the little man before him. \"How you became Blood-Kin to Odin only the Fates know.\" He reboarded his ship, making sure to rough up Loki a bit as he released the energy lock. \"One week banishment, no parole.\" \n\n\"A bit much, don't you think?\" \n\n\"*YOU BLEW UP HER SHIP AND STOLE HER TRANSPORTER LOCK!

What did I come here to do? The wall was white. Was it always white? As if that simple thought was the most important command, the wall transformed into a glittering array of colors.

        "\"No, sah. Not here.\" \n\nFrowning, I glanced over at Attenib. I'd heard a wobble in the man's voice that I didn't recognize. He didn't sound quite like himself. \n\n\"Atten, everything okay?\" I asked in a lowered tone, taking a step closer to him. Damnable insects swooped down at my face, biting and stinging. I managed to smack one, and watched with vicious satisfaction as it slammed into a nearby tree trunk and then dropped, stunned, to the forest floor. \n\nI returned my attention back to my guide. After years alongside Attenib, I knew his moods well, recognized the minor twitches of the muscles beneath his nut-brown skin. I'd worked with him long enough to trust in his uncanny ability to know just where to dig. \n\nBut now, today, he looked nervous, pale despite his leathery, tanned hide. And when he looked back at me, I saw a glint of unexpected emotion in his eyes. \n\nFear. \n\n\"Is this the wrong place to dig?\" I asked again. I stood near him, almost shoulder to shoulder despite the oppressive, humid heat of the jungle. I'd called a halt, so our porters huddled several steps behind, taking shelter in the shade of a large palm. \n\nAgain, Attenib shook his head. \"Right place,\" he said softly. \"But wrong feeling. Not good to dig here.\" \n\nI took a moment to weigh his words. I truly believed that Attenib appreciated our arrangement, that he harbored no resentment towards my ownership of him. After all, I'd treated him far better than his fellows, snapped up on the bidding block to work the fields until their muscles and bodies failed them. But I'd seen his talent, and he'd served me well. \n\nBut we sat on our laurels too long, as I basked in the attention of the Royal Society and failed to note the new naturalists nipping at my heels. I'd secured the funding for this expedition, but one of the Senior Fellows had drawn me aside and warned me that, without results, it would be my last. \n\nI looked again at Attenib. Did he know the conflict in my head? He just looked back, waiting. \n\nI made my decision. \n\n\"Men! Gather your tools!\" I shouted to the hired porters. \"You lot! Axes, to clear the area! You others, picks and shovels! This is the spot!\" \n\nAttenib said nothing, but I saw him shrink back towards the camp. I should have disciplined him, I knew, but I chose to let him go. I had a dig to supervise. \n\nAnd soon, Attenib's almost supernatural talent proved itself once again, as one of the porters let out a cry of surprise. \"Sah! Over here!\" \n\nI hurried over to the man, roughly pushing him aside before he could damage the delicate artifact. But my words died away as I stared, open mouthed, at the object. \n\nSilver metal, curved, suggesting a large cylinder. Rivets in regular lines showed where the plates were anchored together. A hatch, the glass obscured with dust and dirt. And a logo of some sort, a square of blue with white dots, next to red and white stripes. It looked like a flag, albeit one I'd never seen before. \n\n\"What is it?\" I asked, utterly confused. \n\nFrom nearby, Attenib let out another soft moan. \"Evil,\" he answered me. \"Not from this place. It doesn't belong.\" \n\nI bent closer, wiping away more dirt. I saw words, now, stamped on the metal. \"Apollo,\" I read. \"What could that be?\" \n\nUnnoticed, Attenib shrank back, in amid the trees that reminded him of his childhood when he'd laughed and run between their trunks. His master continued to puzzle over the alien thing that he'd felt in the ground, but Attenib could stand here no longer. \n\nWith other objects, he felt their history. That drew him to those hidden beneath the earth, feeling for their long histories, disrupted but to be resumed once unearthed. It became almost beyond notice, the history of all around him, all he touched. \n\nBut this object had no history at all. \n\nAnd as his master found the handle, reached for it, Attenib turned and fled into the trees. He ran blindly, not to anywhere, but just to get *away. * \n\n***** \n\n*Note: this was written on my phone while my SO tries on clothes, so please forgive any spelling/autocorrect errors! *",
        "Janice scratched her butt lazily as she stared at the tall cloaked man in the hallway. She gave him a good look over through her disheveled black hair, taking note of the snow dripping on her doorway, and her eyes momentarily paused on cloven hoofs peaking out from under the hem surrounded by a growing puddle. Odd considering it was New York City in July. But hell, she wasn't a meteorologist. \n\nShe stretched and yawned, and turned away, closing the door sleepily. It was only 2 p.m. and way too early for whatever this guy was trying to sell. \"Sorry, I am not interested.\" \n\nA hoof wedged forward to prevent the door from closing, and a red hand with large claws pushed the door forward. Goat eyes stared down into Janice's annoyed ones. \"What the fuck. Get out.\" The slim girl shoved her shoulder against the door, but it didn't budge against the monster's strength. \"I told you I am not interested.\" \n\nA hiss escaped from the creature's mouth. \"What did you do Janice?\" \n\n\"I don't know. I do know right now I am trying to get your ass out of my apartment. Get out or I am calling the cops!\" \n\nThe monster laughed, \"Cops? Cops? Do you know who I am?\" The heavy wooden door suddenly dissolved into heated ash. Janice stood there momentarily, awkwardly realizing a door no longer stood between her and her intruder. \n\nWith a small, frustrated noise, she dropped the door knob into the crumbling dust of her door and strode into the kitchen. \"Whatever. You are paying for that door. It was.... at least $ 3000. Yeah, that sounds right.\" \n\n\"What? That door was only $ 800 tops. Where did you get a number like-\" He paused, and shook his head angrily, \"No, it doesn't matter. I am here because you ruined Hell. It's like Christmas down there.\" \n\nJanice stomped back into the room, holding a bottle of whiskey. \"Ya don't say. How did little old mortal me do that?\" She took a swig before pouring a glass. She glanced back at the monster. \"You aren't getting any.\" \n\n\"I don't care. I followed the clues-\" \n\n\"Ah, a good ol' fashioned Nancy Drew...\" \n\n\"AND I believe you are behind Hell freezing over.\" \n\nJanice rolled her eyes and gestured impatiently in his general direction.",
        "50 years is a long time, enough time to go crazy and return sane. \n\nI remember before it happened, the [ CDC joked that they would have a cure \"within a week\" ] (http: //www.cdc.gov/phpr/zombies.htm) when they hadn't been able to cure HIV in 32 years, they had known about herpes for 2385 years and only had a treatment, and the flu remained a menace up until there weren't enough humans left to contract it. To the credit of the scientists, they all worked until the only thought they had was about their brain cravings. \n\nI had had a new \"stem cell\" treatment the year before, it helped recover some of the nerve damage I had gotten when I was young and had to have a surgery to correct a malformation. In those days, it seemed that the end to all disease and disfigurement were just around the corner, technology and biology hand in hand to save the human race. The funny thing is, my only guess to my resistance to the zombie infection and the zombies total lack of interest in me is probably due to the stem cell treatment somehow. \n\nThe outbreak didn't take long, it started with a HIV like infection where only if you were bitten or zombie bodily fluids came in contact with someone, only then could you be infected. The virus became symbiotically linked to a bacterial group, then also a mold. With new methods of transmission, only the people on the ISS were safe from infection.... They got to starve to death and have a front row seat to the end of the world. \n\nBy the time the infection made it here, there was no time for panic. The mold set itself up inside of buildings and anything made of wood or anywhere with standing water... by the time it was identified, it had infected everyone. It's spread was attributed to standing water in the water traps of sinks and toilets and their connection to the sewage system. time from infection to zombie was about 6 hours, and was mostly flu like. some people simply fell asleep never to wake with a human thought again. \n\nThe thing about zombies that most zombie movies neglect is thermodynamics. Zombies don't eat other zombies, and most animals can flee zombies or are immune. This means that a zombie must consume material to continue locomotion, and that energy must be expended to remain \"alive\". Once the zombie's guts had rotten past usability, a zombie would only be able to live for about 32 hours. Given that the zombie would run out of ATP fairly quickly, they would spend most of that time too stiff to move. This meant that anyone who was smart enough to remain out of sight, would be able to survive. The actual \"zombie apocalypse\" lasted about 3 years. \n\nYear two I went a bit crazy, I went through a mental breakdown where I assumed I myself must be a zombie and joined a horde. We chased some wildlife, and ate the remains of some survivors that starved to death. It was the sight of that rotting family that snapped me out of it, I slipped away and let the horde... do their thing.... \n\nbut that was 48 years ago, with eternal youth and a city of books and movies you can learn to do anything. So I learned to do pretty much everything. I wasn't going to die anytime soon, I had a garden and traps set up within year 4. So it was easy to learn to make and do everything. \n\nOne of the things I did was set up a \"mesh network\", reprogramming WiFi routers to make a city-wide network that could allow me to monitor and automate things.",
        "Titan pursed his lips as the Hadron collider powered down. \n\n\"Hmm,\" he mused. \"That's all?\" He looked down at the trembling \"scientists\" that came only to his waist. Their fleshy exterior and poorly-constructed internal skeletons disgusted him, and their meager attempts at fusion and fission had barely scratched the surface of their potential, even after a few thousand years of discovering how to harness the power of fire. \n\nDr. Ashe stammered and muttered some reply, but Titan merely scribbled on his clipboard, turned on his heel, and walked away. \n\nHe called over his shoulder, \"looks like low 800,000s, if you're lucky. Anything less than 850,000 gets selected for harvesting!\" he chuckled to himself. That would get them quaking. \n\nHonestly he was rather disgusted with the squabbles and petty rivalries this world had to offer. He mused to himself as he wove through the crowd of onlookers who'd gathered to take his picture. They didn't even have holographic photo-3D mapping, for Ublar's sake! \n\nThe sea of meatbags parted before him, their eyes widening in fear as his sleek armored legs shook the ground beneath their feet. He nearly fell over, however, when a small human child, no more than 7 years old, by his estimation, didn't move out of his way. He looked down angrily, prepared to berate the small boy, but refrained as the boy pulled something from the crinkled blue bag and offered it to Titan. \n\n*Hmph*, he scoffed. No mere gifts or trinkets would sway his decision. He was a professional, and there was nothing, *nothing* that had thus far distinguished the people of this planet in *any* way whatsoev-..... \n\nTitan's eyes widened as the cookie was placed in his hand."

        "The spectral chill that clung to Elias wasn't the afterlife's embrace; it was the dampness of his own grave.  He hovered, translucent and bewildered, above the freshly turned earth, watching his own burial.\n\nA flicker of an idea, a spark in the ethereal mist that constituted his being, ignited. Could he...?  He drifted downwards, sinking into the cold, dark soil.\n\nA jolt, a surge, and then\u2026 sensation.  The weight of earth pressing down, the stiffness of unused limbs.  He was back.  In his body.  Dead, but\u2026 back.\n\nElias lurched upwards, dirt cascading from his suit. The mourners shrieked, scattering like startled crows. He hadn't considered the optics.\n\nBack among the living, or rather, the undead, Elias felt a strange sense of triumph.  He had cheated death, not by escaping it, but by reclaiming it.\n\nNews of Elias's \"resurrection\" spread like wildfire.  The local paper ran a sensationalized front-page story. The internet buzzed with theories, from divine intervention to elaborate pranks.\n\nOne entity, however, remained unconvinced:  Elias's life insurance company.  A large payout was pending, and a resurrected client raised serious red flags.\n\nAn investigator, a sharp-eyed woman named Ms. Thorne, arrived in town.  She was unfazed by the tales of the undead Elias, armed with skepticism and a keen sense of logic.\n\nMs. Thorne visited Elias, observing his stiff movements, his vacant stare. He claimed amnesia, a convenient side effect of his unorthodox return.\n\nShe wasn't buying it.  The insurance company ordered an exhumation.  Elias, panicked, knew he couldn't let them examine his\u2026 himself.\n\nUnder the cover of night, Elias, still inhabiting his own corpse, dug himself out of the grave.  The act felt grotesquely familiar.\n\nHe fled, a reanimated fugitive, seeking refuge in the anonymity of the city.  He was a ghost in his own skin, a walking paradox.\n\nMs. Thorne, alerted to the empty grave, intensified her pursuit. She saw through Elias's charade, recognizing the calculated movements of a man playing dead.\n\nElias found himself in a macabre game of cat and mouse, pursued by an investigator who refused to believe in ghosts, yet hunted one all the same.",
        "The scent was new. Sharp, acrid, and clinging to everything. It laced the wind that rustled through the willows, tainted the sweet scent of poplar, and even tinged the taste of the icy water.  It had arrived with the strange two-legged creatures. At first, there had been only a few, their clumsy wooden dens appearing on the shores like beached whales. But more kept coming, their numbers swelling like the spring thaw flooding the valley.  They were noisy, their calls echoing strangely across the still waters, unlike any sound of the forest.\n\nCuriosity gnawed at me, stronger than the instinct to hide.  From the safety of my lodge, woven deep within the tangle of willow roots, I watched them. They moved with an unsettling awkwardness on land, but in their canoes, they were swift and silent, like otters.  They felled trees with terrifying efficiency, the ring of their metal biting into the wood sending shudders through the very earth. I saw others of my kind, driven by the same dangerous curiosity, caught in the strange traps they laid \u2013 jaws of wood and metal, snapping shut with deadly precision.\n\nThe fear was a cold knot in my belly.  My family huddled together, trembling at the unfamiliar sounds, the strange scent, the growing sense of unease that permeated our once peaceful valley.  We stayed hidden, venturing out only under the cover of darkness, our foraging expeditions becoming shorter, more fraught with danger. The whispers of the trapped ones, their mournful cries echoing through the night, kept us vigilant.  We no longer dared to linger by the banks, to savor the succulent water lilies, to playfully slap our tails on the surface of the moonlit water.\n\nThe river, once our sanctuary, our highway, our provider, had become a place of fear.  The trees, our source of food and shelter, were falling silent, their majestic forms crashing to the earth with a final, heartbreaking groan.  The world, once familiar and predictable, had become a place of shadows and whispers, the scent of fear mingling with the acrid tang of the newcomers.",
        "Your Honor, as I stand here today, I am not just a convicted murderer, but a soul torn by a grief that words can hardly express. I loved my cat, Whiskers, with a purity that few people understand. He was more than a pet; he was a companion, a confidant, and a source of unconditional love. When he was found in the alley behind my house, his body broken and lifeless, a part of me died with him. The crime scene photos, the forensic reports, and the cold, clinical terms used to describe his demise\u2014none of them could capture the depth of my loss.\n\nThe man who took Whiskers from me, Mr. Thompson, was known for his cruelty. He had a history of violence, and his penchant for tormenting animals was a dark secret that many in our community whispered about but never dared to confront. I, however, could not stand idly by. I gathered evidence, I spoke with witnesses, and I pieced together the events of that fateful night. When I finally confronted Mr. Thompson, he laughed in my face. He told me that Whiskers was just a cat, that I should get over it. But I couldn't. The pain was too raw, the injustice too profound.\n\nThat night, I returned to his house. I had no plan, no clear intention. I only knew that I could not let his callousness go unanswered. The moment I saw him, a rage unlike anything I had ever known consumed me. I don\u2019t remember much after that. I only recall the sound of his taunting, the sight of his cold, calculating eyes, and the feel of my hands around his throat. When the police found me, I was still standing over his body, a hollow shell of a man who had lost everything.",
        "In the secluded heart of North Korea, amid the towering mountains and dense forests, Kim Jong-Un stumbled upon an ancient lamp while exploring a hidden cave. The air was thick with dust and the silence was profound. As his fingers brushed against the cold metal, a wisp of smoke emerged, quickly forming into a shimmering genie.\n\nThe genie bowed deeply and said, \"Master, you have freed me from my eternal prison. In return, I will grant you three wishes.\" Kim Jong-Un's eyes widened with astonishment and greed. Without hesitation, he blurted out his first wish: \"I want to be the wisest man in the world!\"\n\nThe room swirled with magical energy as the genie\u2019s hand swept through the air. Suddenly, Kim felt an overwhelming surge of knowledge flooding his mind\u2014history, science, philosophy, politics; everything he could imagine and more poured into him like an endless river.\n\nHowever, as days passed by, Kim discovered that wisdom brought unexpected challenges. He found himself questioning every decision he had ever made and saw flaws in systems he once believed were flawless. His once-confident demeanor began to waver under the weight of infinite knowledge.\n\nKim's advisors noticed a change in him. Instead of issuing commands with absolute authority, he now engaged in long debates about governance and human rights. His speeches grew more philosophical and less doctrinal. The people were bewildered by this new side of their leader.\n\nMeanwhile, international relations shifted dramatically as well. Leaders around the world marveled at Kim\u2019s newfound insights on global peace and economic cooperation. Diplomatic tensions eased as North Korea proposed innovative solutions to longstanding conflicts.\n\nBut within North Korea itself, there were growing murmurs of discontent among loyalists who preferred tradition over transformation.

        "As I lay on my back in the grassy field, I gazed up at the night sky, mesmerized by the twinkling stars. The familiar rhyme echoed in my mind, a childhood lullaby that had always sparked my imagination. I felt tiny and insignificant in the vastness of the universe, yet connected to something much bigger than myself.\n\nThe stars seemed to pulse with a gentle rhythm, as if they were alive and breathing. I wondered what secrets they held, what stories they could tell if only they could speak. Were they distant suns, burning bright with fiery passion? Or were they remnants of a long-lost civilization, their light a lingering whisper of a forgotten past?\n\nAs I pondered these questions, a shooting star blazed across the sky, its trail glowing like embers. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I made a wish, hoping that this fleeting moment of beauty would bring me good fortune. The star's swift passage left behind a smudge of light, like a brushstroke on the canvas of the universe.\n\nI watched as the smudge grew larger, taking on a life of its own. It began to swirl and eddy, forming tendrils that reached out like ethereal fingers. The star's remnants seemed to be coalescing into something tangible, something that was falling swiftly from the sky.\n\nMy heart skipped a beat as I realized that this was no ordinary meteorite. It was descending with an almost deliberate slowness, as if it were being guided by an unseen force. The air around me seemed to vibrate with anticipation, charged with an electric sense of possibility.\n\nAs the object drew closer, its shape became clearer. It was small and spherical, glowing with an soft blue light that illuminated the surrounding landscape. The sphere hovered above me for an instant before landing softly in the grass nearby.\n\nI approached it cautiously, feeling as though I were entering sacred territory. The sphere pulsed gently at my feet enigmatic and mysterious presence emanated from it radiating ancient knowledge which overwhelmed all who possessed such power inside themselves already waiting patiently without any effort required whatsoever inside now!",

        "Hidden deep within the volcanic caverns of Mount Cinder, a lair pulsed with a life of its own. Gleaming chrome surfaces reflected the eerie glow of lava-powered generators, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mimic the movements of the figures within. At the heart of this subterranean complex, a figure stood bathed in the crimson light \u2013 a man known only as Benefactor.\n\nClad in a bespoke suit of obsidian armor, his face concealed by a polished metal mask, Benefactor surveyed his domain with a dramatic sweep of his gloved hand. His voice, amplified by the lair's advanced acoustics, resonated with an almost theatrical quality. \"Behold, my dedicated cohorts,\" he boomed, his words echoing through the cavernous space, \"the crucible of a new world order!\"\n\nHis assembled henchmen, clad in matching dark uniforms, stood in rigid attention. Their expressions, hidden behind identical masks, betrayed no emotion, but an air of anticipation filled the room. They were the instruments of Benefactor's grand design, the executors of his philanthropic vision.\n\n\"The world above,\" Benefactor continued, his voice dripping with theatrical disdain, \"is riddled with imperfections. Poverty, inequality, and environmental decay \u2013 like insidious tendrils, they consume everything.\" He paused to allow the image to sink in, and he spread his arms wide, his armored form mirroring a dark angel, spreading his wings.\n\n\"Such a state of affairs is intolerable. Thus, I have devised an intricate scheme to elevate humanity to loftier heights!\" With renewed exuberance, his pronouncements rang with near-religious fervor.\n\nHis plan \u2013 audacious in its grandeur yet noble in its intent. Benefactor envisioned a world where poverty was eradicated, disease was a forgotten relic, and access to free quality education blanketed most, if not all, of Earth.\n\nThough his methods mirrored that of a classic supervillain, including secret lairs and monologues in which he revealed his master plan to captive audiences which consisted of his henchmen only, his heart, however eccentrically displayed, was driven by genuine altruism. \n\nBut appearances are often deceptive. His demeanor and the theatrics of his persona had led to several misinterpretations by the outside world, particularly the media. The city's leading newspaper ran a front-page story with a screaming headline, \"Supervillain Threatens World Domination!\" The mayor held a press conference where fear was palpable, as promises to 'protect the citizens' were made.\n\nUnaware of these narratives, Benefactor pressed on with the first phase of his plan. He would start by revolutionizing the city's education system. Utilizing his vast wealth and advanced technology, he intended to build state-of-the-art, environmentally friendly learning centers for underprivileged children, each fully supplied with the latest AI assistants and catered by renowned chefs who would present healthy, balanced meals to the kids free of cost.\n\nBenefactor's henchmen, skilled but also equipped with the knowledge and resources worthy of any elite task force of do-gooders, set off towards each end of the city in sleek, black vans that could easily pass as special-ops vehicles in any police station parking garage.",
        "Once upon a time, there was a quaint little village nestled in the rolling hills. The people of the village were kind and lived harmoniously, sharing laughter and joy every day. Children played in the meadows, farmers tended to their crops, and the sun shone bright, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink each evening.\n\nOne night, as the full moon cast an ethereal glow over the village, strange occurrences began to unfold. Shadows danced in the corners, whispers echoed through empty streets, and an ominous chill permeated the once-warm air.

        "In a twisted reality, Adolf Hitler was not just the dictator of Germany but also an unlikely chronicler of his encounters with time-traveling assassins. From the moment of his birth in a small Austrian town, these mysterious figures had been attempting to alter history by eradicating him from existence. Each chapter of his book, \"Mein Kampf,\" delved into these relentless pursuits, painting a picture of a man not only battling political adversaries but also shadowy figures from the future. He recounted how, as a young boy, he narrowly escaped a temporal assassin disguised as a traveling salesman, and later, as a struggling artist in Vienna, he evaded a sophisticated attack involving a weapon that seemed to harness energy from another dimension. The book detailed his rise to power, interwoven with accounts of these clandestine battles. He described one particularly harrowing incident where he survived an attempt on his life during a speech in Munich, only to later discover that the bomb had been activated by a device hidden in the pocket watch of a man who claimed to be from the year 2050. Hitler\u2019s narrative grew increasingly paranoid, suggesting that some of his closest aides were actually spies from the future, sent to monitor his actions. Despite the absurdity of his claims, \"Mein Kampf\" became a bestseller, not for its historical accuracy or political ideology, but for its bizarre and unsettling account of a man caught in a time war. The public, intrigued and horrified, devoured every page, never fully grasping the line between reality and delusion in Hitler\u2019s twisted mind.",

The news spread like wildfire, causing chaos and confusion among the residents who were now grappling with their altered identities.\n\nSam had always been proud to call himself an American, but now he felt lost in this unfamiliar territory with its different customs and language. As he walked through the streets that once felt like home, everything seemed foreign and out of place. The flags that used to fly proudly now bore strange symbols, and the once familiar landmarks were adorned with banners proclaiming allegiance to their new rulers.\n\nDespite the uncertainty swirling around him, Sam knew he had to adapt quickly if he wanted to survive in this changed world. He sought out others who had also found themselves thrust into this new reality, forming connections based on shared experiences of displacement and confusion. Together, they navigated the challenges of adjusting to their newfound citizenship while holding onto memories of their American past.\n\nAmidst all the upheaval, one thing remained constant for Sam \u2013 his unwavering resilience and determination not to let circumstances define him. He refused to be defeated by this sudden twist of fate; instead, he saw it as an opportunity for growth and reinvention. With each passing day, Sam learned more about his new homeland - its traditions, its history, and its people - slowly integrating himself into the fabric of society.\n\nAs time went on, Sam discovered a sense of belonging that transcended borders or political affiliations. He realized that home was not just a place on a map but rather where one's heart resided - among friends who stood by him through thick and thin; in moments shared over meals or laughter; in finding common ground with strangers turned neighbors.\n\nThrough perseverance and open-mindedness, Sam forged a new identity that encompassed both his American roots and his adopted nationality. He became a bridge between two worlds - offering insights into each culture while embracing diversity as strength rather than division. And though the road ahead was uncertain still,\nSam faced it with courage born from knowing that true citizenship lay not just in legal documents but in embracing change with an open heart.",

Due to a clerical error and some very creative interpretation of inheritance law, he's now your only living relative.\"\n\nThe nurse continued, her voice growing increasingly uncertain, \"There's something else. Remember that banana lottery ticket you bought the day of your accident?\"\n\nJames didn't remember, but he nodded anyway.\n\n\"Well, you won. You won big. You now have unlimited access to every banana that will ever be grown on Earth. Forever.\"\n\nHerbert the penguin nodded solemnly, adjusting his bowtie with his flipper.",
        "In the shadowed corners of the city, where the neon lights flickered unevenly, there was a legend. It wasn't about a hero or a saint but about someone far more elusive\u2014a spectral figure known only as \"The Weaver.\" No one had ever seen him, save for those who had crossed his path and never returned to tell their tale. The city's inhabitants whispered of him in hushed tones, their voices trembling with a mix of fear and fascination.\n\nRumors circulated that The Weaver appeared when you least expected it, materializing from the very fabric of the shadows. He was said to be a master of disguise, capable of blending into any crowd or slipping through locked doors as if they were mere suggestions. But it wasn't his skill at evasion that made him legendary; it was his method. Each victim was found in a different location, each body meticulously arranged in intricate patterns that defied explanation.\n\nDetective Elara Cross had been assigned to the case for over six months. She was young but determined, with an intellect sharp enough to cut through even the thickest layers of deceit. Her office walls were covered in maps and photographs, each one connected by red string like veins in a sprawling mural. She spent countless nights poring over evidence, trying to find some pattern that would lead her to The Weaver.\n\nOne night, as she sat alone in her dimly lit office, she received an anonymous message on her phone: \"Why do you kill?\" The question itself sent chills down her spine. It was bold and direct\u2014precisely what she would expect from someone like The Weaver.\n\nShe replied immediately: \"Because I can. Because I'm good at it. Because I like it.\"\n\nThe phone buzzed again almost instantly: \"Meet me at the abandoned warehouse on 5th Street if you dare.\"\n\nElara hesitated for only a moment before grabbing her coat and heading out into the night. As she approached the warehouse, shadows seemed to grow thicker around her, swallowing every bit of light until she felt as though she were walking through tar.",
        "In the blur between consciousness and the void, I awoke to a peculiar sensation. My sight was limited to what lay directly in front of me, and my body felt foreign. I tried to move, but instead of limbs, I felt the lightest of movements, akin to floating. Panic surged through me, but it was quickly replaced by familiarity as memories flooded back\u2014memories of a life I thought I had left behind.\n\nI was once a human, a man named Eliot, who lived a life filled with dreams and ambitions that seemed insignificant now. I had died under mysterious circumstances, an unsolved case that haunted the last moments of my existence. Now, I found myself staring at the world from a new perspective, one that was not quite like any I remembered. I was a bird, a tiny sparrow perched on the edge of a wide, open field.\n\nThe realization hit me hard. I was reborn, but not as I had hoped. I was a creature of the sky, bound by instinct and survival. The challenge was to find meaning in this new form, to merge my human consciousness with the nature-driven essence of my avian self. It was a strange dichotomy, a human mind trapped in a bird\u2019s body, but it was the reality I now faced.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and weeks into months. I learned to navigate the skies, to avoid predators, and to find shelter in the trees. I observed the world below, witnessing the lives of the humans I once belonged to. They moved about their days, oblivious to the small, silent observer above. I saw joy, sorrow, kindness, and cruelty, and I felt a sense of connection, a longing for the complexity of human emotions.\n\nOne day, while perched on a power line, I watched a young boy throw bread crumbs to the birds. He laughed as they flitted around, pecking at the food. Something stirred within me. I had always been a storyteller, crafting narratives that resonated with others. Perhaps, in this new form, I could still find a way to communicate, to share my experiences, even if only with the creatures around me.\n\nI began to use my voice, not to speak in words, but to sing.",
        "Beneath the shade of a sprawling oak, Clara knelt in her mother\u2019s garden, a place once vibrant with colorful blooms. Now, only brittle stems and faded petals remained. Her mother had always said, \"It's no use watering dead flowers,\" but Clara found herself unable to let go.\n\nEach morning, she carried a chipped enamel pitcher filled with water, determined to coax life back into the wilted garden. She reminisced about the afternoons spent by her mother\u2019s side, learning the secrets of nurturing each unique plant. This was their sanctuary, where worries evaporated like dew under the sun.\n\nOne day, as Clara poured water onto the parched soil, an old neighbor leaned over the fence, shaking his head. \"They\u2019re gone, dear,\" he said softly, gesturing at the wilted blossoms. Yet, Clara continued her ritual, believing that somehow, her persistence could defy nature's finality.\n\nWeeks passed, and Clara noticed something peculiar. Amidst the sea of decay, a single green shoot emerged, tiny and fragile. Her heart swelled with hope as she nurtured this sign of resilience. It seemed improbable, yet there it was\u2014a testament to the power of perseverance.\n\nWord of the miracle spread, and soon others came to witness the unexpected revival. They marveled at Clara's unwavering dedication, whispering legends of her enchanted touch.\n\nAs spring unfolded, the garden slowly awakened, vibrant colors weaving through the once barren patches. Clara realized then, sometimes, it's not about saving what's lost but about finding new beginnings.",
        "The dull drone of Mr. Harrison's voice washed over ten-year-old Leo, a wave of monotonous sound crashing against the shores of his boredom.  Quadratic equations danced mockingly on the whiteboard, their cryptic symbols a language he couldn't decipher.  His mind, a restless butterfly, flitted away from the algebraic wilderness, seeking refuge in the familiar comfort of his sketchbook.\n\nUnder the cover of his textbook, Leo's pencil danced across the page.  He wasn't drawing anything in particular, just letting his hand guide him, creating an intricate tapestry of lines and curves.  A circle formed, then another inside it, connected by delicate, spiraling lines.  Smaller circles blossomed within the larger ones, each a tiny universe of its own.\n\nUnconsciously, Leo began incorporating symbols he'd seen in an old, leather-bound book he'd found tucked away in his attic.  Strange, angular characters, unlike any alphabet he knew, flowed from his pencil, weaving themselves into the growing design.\n\nHe added shading, the graphite deepening the lines, creating a sense of depth and dimension.  The design pulsed on the page, a strange energy emanating from its intricate heart.\n\nSuddenly, a faint hum filled the air.  The classroom lights flickered, casting dancing shadows on the walls.  Mr. Harrison paused mid-equation, a puzzled frown creasing his forehead.\n\nLeo stared at his drawing, his heart pounding in his chest.  The air around the sketchbook crackled with an unseen energy, a tingling sensation prickling his skin.\n\nThe lines on the page began to glow, a soft, ethereal light emanating from the center of the circle.  The hum intensified, resonating deep within Leo's bones.\n\nA gust of wind swept through the classroom, rustling papers and sending textbooks tumbling to the floor.  The temperature dropped dramatically, a sudden chill replacing the stuffy classroom air.\n\nThe glowing intensified, the light spilling over the edges of the sketchbook, bathing the room in an otherworldly radiance.  The air shimmered, distorting the familiar surroundings.\n\nFor a moment, time seemed to stand still.  Then, with a blinding flash, the light vanished.\n\nSilence descended upon the classroom, broken only by the rapid thump-thump-thump of Leo's heart.  He looked down at his sketchbook, his eyes wide with disbelief.\n\nThe drawing was gone, replaced by a blank page.  But the air still crackled with residual energy, a silent testament to the extraordinary event that had just transpired.",
        "In the year 2056, Earth found itself caught in the middle of a cosmic conflict. Two powerful alien races, the Lumarians and the Draxians, descended upon our planet claiming to be humanity's protectors. The skies lit up with their advanced spacecraft as they clashed in epic battles that shook the very foundations of our world.\n\nThe Lumarians were graceful beings with shimmering silver skin and telepathic abilities. They promised peace and enlightenment for mankind, offering advanced technology and knowledge beyond our wildest dreams. On the other side stood the Draxians, fierce warriors clad in black armor with eyes that glowed like embers. They claimed to be defending humanity from external threats lurking in the vastness of space.\n\nCaught between these two formidable forces, humans watched in awe and fear as cities crumbled and forests burned under the onslaught of extraterrestrial weapons. Some saw hope in the Lumarians' promises of harmony and progress, while others found solace in the Draxians' fierce protection against unknown dangers.\n\nAs Earth became a battleground for these warring factions, ordinary people were forced to pick sides or seek refuge underground. The once peaceful planet now echoed with explosions and alien war cries that drowned out human voices pleading for mercy.\n\nAmidst this chaos, a small group of brave individuals emerged who believed that humanity's fate should rest in its own hands. They sought ways to unite their divided world against both alien invaders, realizing that true protection could only come from within.\n\nAnd so, as Earth trembled under alien feet and skies blazed with interstellar fire, a new chapter dawned for humankind \u2013 one where our destiny hung on a precarious balance between two rival races claiming to be our saviors.",
        "I sat in the waiting room, the sterile scent of antiseptic lingering in the air. It had been seven days since I'd received the call about being selected, a lifeline thrown to me amidst quiet desperation.\n\nThe doors opened, and a nurse beckoned me forward with an encouraging smile. Her kindness contrasted sharply with the storm within my mind.\n\nAs I was led down narrow corridors, I couldn't help but wonder what this \"experimental treatment\" would entail. Doubt gnawed at my insides like never before. \n\n\"We're ready,\" said a calm voice from beyond another door - Dr. Elara Parker stood there, exuding both authority and warmth.\n\nHer office didn't resemble any medical room I'd anticipated; instead it felt serene \u2013 soft colors splashed across walls illuminated by gentle lighting reflected off tranquil blue fish tanks lining shelves as she briefed about procedure specifics: technology designed for those whom conventional therapies failed!",
        "The final scene of \"Whispers in the Shadows\" flickered on my screen, the tension in the dimly lit mansion palpable.  Detective Harding, our stoic protagonist, stood before the ornate fireplace, his eyes scanning the room filled with the usual suspects.  I knew, with a chilling certainty, who the killer was. It was Evelyn, the seemingly meek librarian with a penchant for floral prints.\n\nEvelyn's subtle lip twitch, the fleeting glance she\u2019d shared earlier to the poison dart frog the museum was displaying at exactly timestamp 4:17 of the fourth to the last episode,  the innocuous bird figurine clutched in her hand \u2013 all unmistakable clues.  The showrunners hadn't even tried to be subtle.  It was a caricature of a twist, a blatant neon sign screaming, \"She's the killer! It was her the entire time!\"\n\nYet the internet remained oblivious.  My phone buzzed with messages from friends and family, guessing wildly, throwing out ridiculous red herrings carefully manufactured as subterfuge to mislead the entire audience from Evelyn, the person who set events into place since the literal first act of the very first episode during last year's season premiere.  Nobody, absolutely nobody, mentioned it or any of her actions, or even the frog or her obvious reactions whenever somebody mentions frog toxins. Nobody suspected the one woman who seemed an \"obvious\" option to viewers.  \n\nMy wife, perched beside me on the couch, was convinced it was the butler, a classic trope the writers seemed to deliberately overplay. \"It's always the butler,\" she said, a smug smile playing on her lips.  I opened my mouth to correct her, to point out the flashing neon signs pointing towards Evelyn's guilt, but the words caught in my throat.\n\nA wave of uneasiness washed over me. Why was I the only one who saw it?  Was I reading too much into it?  Was the show's blatant obviousness a deliberate meta-commentary, a sly wink at the audience?",
        "In the bustling city of Metropia, a place where skyscrapers kissed the clouds and neon lights painted the night, two men lived in a modest apartment on the 23rd floor of an old brick building. This apartment was their sanctuary, their retreat from the chaos of everyday life. The roommates were as different as night and day, yet they had formed an unlikely bond over two years.\n\nEthan Stone was a tech genius with a heart of gold. He spent his days at a cutting-edge research lab, developing technologies to improve lives. At night, he transformed into Quantum Knight, a superhero known for his agility and energy-manipulating abilities. His secret lair was hidden in his bedroom closet, where he kept his high-tech suit and gadgets.\n\nHis roommate, Lucas Blackwood, appeared to be just another struggling artist trying to make ends meet with part-time jobs and freelance work. What no one knew was that when darkness fell over Metropia, Lucas donned a dark cloak and became Nocturne\u2014the city\u2019s most feared supervillain. His powers allowed him to manipulate shadows and move unseen.\n\nTheir mornings began in harmony; Ethan would brew coffee while Lucas set out breakfast cereal on the table. They\u2019d chat about mundane topics\u2014work stressors or funny moments from TV shows they watched together. Neither suspected that their casual conversations were laced with hidden meanings only each could fully understand.\n\nOne evening, Ethan returned home later than usual after foiling another one of Nocturne\u2019s schemes at City Hall. His muscles ached from the intense battle against invisible foes who manipulated darkness itself against him. As he entered their apartment quietly so as not to disturb Lucas who usually went to bed early these days due to late-night painting sessions (or so Ethan thought), he noticed something peculiar\u2014a faint smudge of black paint on the kitchen counter.\n\nThe next morning over breakfast cereal (Lucas\u2019 favorite brand), Ethan casually mentioned having seen strange marks around town lately\u2014marks suspiciously similar to those used by Nocturne during attacks but also quite like some abstract art pieces found scattered throughout Metropia recently attributed mysteriously enough...to someone calling themselves 'Shadowbrush.'\n\nLucas looked up sharply but quickly recovered himself before responding lightly about how coincidences happen all the time in such large cities especially ones teeming with creativity like theirs did every single day without fail or exception whatsoever really now don\u2019t you agree?\n\nDays turned into weeks; tensions mounted subtly beneath layers of normalcy within those four walls shared between them both unaware enemies yet unaware allies too perhaps?\n\nEthan began noticing other oddities: missing files from his laptop (conveniently replaced later); unexplained power fluctuations affecting only certain areas inside their unit; even occasional whispers late at night when both claimed insomnia plagued them equally though reasons differed greatly between good guy versus bad guy insomnia causes obviously!\n\nMeanwhile, Lucas struggled internally more than ever before because here lived not just any ordinary neighbor but potentially THE person standing directly opposite him across this great divide separating heroes from villains once peaceful coexistence shattered irrevocably if truth ever came out disrupting everything carefully constructed thus far...\n\nThen came THE NIGHT\u2014a stormy evening filled with lightning strikes illuminating stark contrasts everywhere including inside this otherwise cozy shared living space suddenly feeling much smaller somehow...\n\nQuantum Knight stood atop City Hall again facing off against Nocturne whose shadowy tendrils snaked dangerously close towards innocent bystanders caught unaware amidst escalating hostilities threatening catastrophic outcomes unless stopped immediately no matter what it took even breaking rules established long ago unbeknownst either participant involved tonight\u2019s showdown destined differently perhaps...\n\nBack at home base meanwhile unnoticed until now thanks partly design choices made initially planning stages notoriously forgetful roommates finally realized SOMETHING WAS OFF BIG TIME YES INDEED WHEN THEY BOTH RETURNED SIMULTANEOUSLY TO FIND THEIR DOOR LOCKED FROM INSIDE!\n\nPanic set in quickly followed closely behind by realization dawning simultaneously upon them triggering floodgates releasing torrents long-suppressed suspicions ideas theories questions ultimately culminating explosive confrontation encapsulated brief moment suspended outside typical reality frameworks governing existence normally understood universally accepted widely practiced etcetera etcetera etcetera...\n\n\u201cYOU!\u201d They shouted almost comically mirroring identical accusatory tones pointing fingers squarely center stage directly opposing counterparts neither backing down despite overwhelming evidence mounting rapidly confirming worst fears harbored deep down secretly nurtured subconsciously unknowingly mutually held albeit silently acknowledged tacit awareness underlying superficial camaraderie maintained meticulously preserved diligently protected jealously guarded zealously pursued relentlessly sought after cherished immensely valued immensely respected deeply admired genuinely liked honestly enjoyed truly appreciated sincerely grateful for beyond measure imaginable biblically proportioned universe spanning epoch defining saga worthy recounting generations henceforth forevermore amen hallelujah...",
        "In the small town of Willowbrook, nestled between vast fields of corn and the whispering woods, there sat an old, red-bricked house at the end of a winding dirt road. It was the kind of house that held stories in its bones, with creaky floorboards and a wraparound porch where the paint peeled away like forgotten memories. The house belonged to Mr. Hargrove, a solitary man with a penchant for collecting clocks that ticked in every corner of his home.\n\nOne crisp autumn afternoon, a soft knock echoed through the hallway. Mr. Hargrove, with his silver spectacles perched precariously on his nose, shuffled to the door. There stood a young girl, no more than ten, with eyes the color of storm clouds and hair like spun gold. She clutched a small, tattered teddy bear in her arms.\n\n\"Hello, sir,\" she said softly, her voice barely above a whisper. \"My name is Elara. May I come in?\"\n\nMr. Hargrove, taken aback by the unexpected visitor, nodded and stepped aside. Elara walked in, her small feet padding softly against the wooden floor. She looked around with wide eyes, taking in the myriad of clocks that adorned every wall.\n\n\"That's quite a collection you have,\" she remarked, her voice echoing off the walls like a distant memory. \"I've never seen so many clocks in one place.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Mr. Hargrove replied, a hint of pride in his voice. \"Each one tells a story, each tick a moment captured in time.\"\n\nElara nodded, her eyes lingering on a particularly ornate grandfather clock in the corner. Its pendulum swung lazily back and forth, a metronome marking the passage of time. She seemed to hesitate before speaking again.\n\n\"Can I ask you something, Mr. Hargrove? Something important?\"\n\nThe old man nodded, curious about the child's serious demeanor. \"Of course, my dear. What is it?\"\n\nElara took a deep breath, her small hands tightening around her teddy bear. \"I want you to close your eyes and pretend everything's alright. Just for a moment.\"\n\nMr. Hargrove's brow furrowed in confusion, but he complied. He shut his eyes and let the world inside his mind unfold, a canvas of peace that painted over the chaos of reality. For that brief moment, the ticking of the clocks faded into the background, replaced by the gentle rustle of leaves and the distant call of a morning dove.\n\n\"Do you see it?\" Elara asked, her voice soft and hopeful.\n\nHe nodded, a faint smile curling his lips. \"Yes, I see it. A world untouched by worry, where the sun always shines and the night is full of stars.\"\n\nElara smiled, a warmth spreading across her features like sunlight breaking through clouds. \"That's where I go when things get too hard,\" she admitted, her voice tinged with vulnerability. \"It's a place where I'm never alone, and everything's just... right.\"\n\nMr. Hargrove opened his eyes, a newfound understanding shimmering in their depths. \"And what brings you here, to this old house at the edge of town?\"\n\nElara hesitated, the silence stretching between them like a fragile thread. \"I lost something,\" she said finally, her voice barely above a whisper.",
        "In the dim light of their favorite bar, Jake watched as Mike charmed yet another woman with his signature smile. For three years, Jake had played the dutiful wingman, crafting the perfect setups and smoothing awkward conversations for his best friend's romantic pursuits.\n\nTonight felt different, though. Each time Mike's hand brushed against his target's arm, Jake felt a twinge in his chest that he couldn't ignore. The realization had been creeping up on him for months, but here, surrounded by the familiar scent of stale beer and cheap perfume, it finally crystallized.\n\nHe was in love with his best friend, and it was destroying him from the inside out.\n\nTheir friendship had started in college, two freshmen bonding over late-night gaming sessions and shared dreams. Mike had always been the confident one, the natural leader who drew people in like moths to a flame. Jake had been content to orbit in his shadow, finding comfort in their easy companionship.\n\n\"Hey, buddy, I think I'm striking out here,\" Mike suddenly appeared beside him, running a hand through his tousled dark hair. \"Want to head out?\" The familiar warmth in Mike's voice made Jake's heart skip a beat, and he hated himself for it.\n\nThey stumbled out into the cool night air, Mike's arm draped casually around Jake's shoulders as they walked. Every point of contact felt like electricity, and Jake wondered if this was how all those women felt when Mike touched them \u2013 like they were simultaneously burning and drowning.\n\nThe street lights cast long shadows as they made their way home, and Jake listened to Mike ramble about his latest dating disaster. He forced himself to laugh at all the right moments, to play his part in their well-rehearsed dance, all while his secret threatened to burst from his chest.\n\nTomorrow, he would wake up and continue being the perfect wingman, burying his feelings beneath layers of friendly banter and forced smiles. But tonight, in the quiet spaces between their words, Jake allowed himself to imagine a different ending to their story \u2013 one where the wingman finally got the guy.",
        "In a world where all 10 billion humans wore wristbands that displayed their rank in terms of access to global resources in real time, the concept of equality had taken on a whole new meaning. These wristbands, embedded with advanced technology, were not just fashion statements but a reflection of one's status in society. For John, a regular office worker in the bustling city of Metropolis, his wristband had always hovered around the middle of the pack, a comfortable position that allowed him to live a decent life.\n\nHowever, on a seemingly ordinary Tuesday afternoon, everything changed. John was sitting at his desk, going about his daily tasks, when he felt a sudden vibration on his wrist. Glancing down, he saw his wristband display flickering erratically before settling on a new number - #19. His heart skipped a beat as he tried to make sense of the sudden jump in his ranking. What could have caused such a drastic change in just ten minutes?\n\nAs the news of his newfound status spread like wildfire through the office, John found himself at the center of attention. Colleagues whispered and pointed in his direction, their eyes filled with a mixture of awe and envy. The higher-ups called him into a meeting room, eager to discuss his elevated rank and its potential implications. John's mind raced with possibilities, his heart pounding in his chest.\n\nThe company's CEO, a stern yet composed woman named Dr. Evergreen, sat across from him, studying him intently. \"Congratulations, John,\" she began, her voice smooth and authoritative. \"You have been chosen to represent our organization at the Global Resource Summit next week.\" John's eyes widened in disbelief. The Global Resource Summit was a prestigious event where the world's most influential individuals gathered to discuss and negotiate the distribution of resources on a global scale.\n\nDr. Evergreen continued, \"Your sudden rise in rank has caught the attention of many, and we believe you have the potential to make a significant impact at the summit. This is a rare opportunity, one that could change the course of your future and our company's standing in the world.\" John was overwhelmed by the magnitude of the responsibility placed upon his shoulders, but deep down, he felt a sense of determination stirring within him.\n\nAs the days passed and the summit drew closer, John immersed himself in research and preparation. He delved into the intricacies of resource allocation, studied the latest trends in global economics, and familiarized himself with the key players in the field. His once mundane existence had been transformed into a whirlwind of excitement and anticipation.\n\nFinally, the day of the summit arrived. John donned his finest suit, his wristband glowing brightly with the number 19 emblazoned on its display. As he entered the grand hall where the summit was being held, he was met with a sea of faces from all corners of the globe. Leaders, diplomats, and visionaries mingled and conversed, their wristbands flashing with varying numbers that denoted their influence and power.\n\nJohn took a deep breath and approached a group of dignitaries engaged in a heated discussion. With confidence he didn't know he possessed, he voiced his opinions on resource sustainability and equitable distribution, drawing the attention of those around him. His words resonated with passion and authenticity, sparking a dialogue that reverberated throughout the hall.\n\nAs the summit progressed, John found himself at the center of negotiations and debates, his voice becoming a beacon of hope for those who sought a fairer and more balanced world. He forged alliances, brokered deals, and challenged the status quo with a fearlessness that surprised even himself.",
        "In the year 2147, humanity achieved a breakthrough in astrophysics with the creation of a device capable of scanning the event horizon of black holes. Scientists were eager to unravel the mysteries shrouded within these cosmic enigmas. The first black hole chosen for testing emitted an ominous aura, its gravitational pull unsettling.\n\nAs the device activated, images began to materialize on the screens - fragments of worlds, shattered civilizations, and remnants of forgotten technologies. The team was mesmerized yet deeply disturbed by what they saw. It was as though the black hole held a record of everything it had consumed over eons.\n\nAmong the debris were echoes of lost voices, whispers of regrets, and shadows of past glories extinguished by the hungry void. The scientists realized that the black hole was not merely a celestial vacuum but a cosmic graveyard, preserving the memories of countless civilizations devoured by its insatiable appetite.\n\nAs the last images faded, a somber silence filled the research facility. The team's discovery raised profound questions about the nature of existence and the fragility of all things in the vast expanse of the universe.

Without hesitation, she stepped away from her hurried commute and offered her assistance. The man, initially surprised by her gesture, gratefully accepted. As they walked together, he shared that he was a retired music teacher who still gave free piano lessons to underprivileged children in his neighborhood. Sarah smiled, thinking how such a simple act of helping him carry his groceries seemed insignificant in comparison.\n\nThree months later, Sarah found herself in an unexpected predicament when her car broke down on a rainy evening. As she stood there, drenched and frustrated, a car pulled over. To her amazement, it was one of her elderly friend's piano students' parents who recognized her from the grocery store that day. The parent had heard about Sarah's kindness and insisted on helping her, proving that kindness has a way of coming full circle, often in the most unexpected ways.",
        "In the gaslit streets of 1840s London, Edward Blackwood adjusted his top hat, his leather-gloved fingers trembling with anticipation as he watched his quarry through the fog.\n\nThomas Sterling, that pompous merchant who had destroyed Edward's family name, emerged from his counting house, completely unaware of the shadow that had stalked him for months.\n\nThe bitter taste of revenge had sustained Edward through five long years of plotting, ever since Sterling had falsely accused his father of embezzlement, leading to his imprisonment and subsequent death in the notorious Newgate Prison.\n\nEdward had lost everything - his inheritance, his standing in society, and most painfully, his betrothed, who had married Sterling himself mere months after Edward's fall from grace.\n\nThe cobblestones echoed with Sterling's footsteps as he made his way through the warren of narrow streets, his silver-tipped cane clicking against the ground in a rhythm that matched Edward's heartbeat.\n\nTonight would be different from all the other nights of watching and waiting; Edward had finally discovered Sterling's weakness, and he would exploit it with the same ruthless efficiency that Sterling had shown in destroying his family.\n\nThe merchant turned down a particularly dark alley - a shortcut he often took to his favorite gentleman's club - and Edward smiled beneath his false mustache, knowing the trap was about to be sprung.\n\nAs Sterling passed beneath a flickering gas lamp, Edward stepped out of the shadows, his voice barely above a whisper as he said, \"Good evening, Mr. Sterling.\"\n\nThe merchant froze, his hand tightening on his cane as he squinted through the fog at the familiar yet unplaceable figure before him.\n\n\"Who are you, sir?\" Sterling demanded, his voice carrying the entitled tone of a man unused to being accosted in the street.\n\nEdward slowly removed his false mustache and watched with satisfaction as recognition dawned in Sterling's eyes, followed quickly by fear.\n\n\"Impossible,\" Sterling breathed, taking a step backward. \"You left London years ago.\"\n\n\"I returned,\" Edward replied simply, drawing a pistol from beneath his coat. \"And I've learned so much during my absence.\"\n\nSterling raised his hands, his face pale in the weak lamplight. \"Whatever you're planning, Blackwood, I assure you it won't bring you peace.\"\n\nEdward's laugh was hollow as he advanced on his prey. \"Peace? I stopped seeking peace the day my father drew his last breath in that prison cell.\"\n\n\"Your father was a thief!\" Sterling spat, his fear giving way to anger. \"I merely exposed his crimes!\"\n\nEdward's finger tightened on the trigger. \"Interesting choice of words, considering what I've discovered about your own business practices.\"\n\nSterling's expression flickered, and Edward knew he had struck a nerve. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"The missing shipments, the forged manifests, the bribes to customs officials - all meticulously documented in your private ledger,\" Edward said softly.\n\nThe color drained from Sterling's face as he realized the extent of Edward's knowledge.\n\n\"How did you-\" Sterling began, but Edward cut him off with a wave of his pistol.\n\n\"Your new wife - my former fianc\u00e9e - was quite helpful, though not intentionally,\" Edward smiled. \"She still keeps her old habit of leaving windows unlocked.\"\n\nSterling's composure cracked entirely. \"Name your price,\" he whispered hoarsely.\n\nEdward reached into his coat with his free hand and withdrew a thick envelope. \"Sign this confession, and I'll keep your secrets.\"\n\nSterling's hands shook as he read the document by lamplight, his eyes widening with each paragraph.\n\n\"This would ruin me completely,\" he protested, looking up at Edward with pleading eyes.\n\n\"Just as you ruined my father,\" Edward replied coldly. \"Sign it.\"\n\nAs Sterling reached for the offered pen, Edward felt the years of hatred beginning to crystallize into something else - something unexpected.\n\nThe merchant's signature was barely dry when Edward lowered his pistol and said, \"Now, we're going to walk to the nearest police station.\"\n\nWhat happened next would haunt Edward's dreams for years to come - Sterling began to laugh, softly at first, then with increasing hysteria.\n\n\"Oh, my dear boy,\" Sterling wheezed between bursts of laughter, \"you really should have done more research.\"\n\nEdward's blood ran cold as he heard footsteps behind him and realized that Sterling's route through this alley had been no coincidence.\n\n\"You see,\" Sterling continued, straightening his coat, \"I've known about your return for weeks. And I'm not the only one who can manufacture evidence.\"\n\nThe last thing Edward saw before everything went black was Sterling's triumphant smile - the same smile he had worn the day Edward's father was arrested.\n\nWhen Edward awoke in Newgate Prison three days later, charged with attempted murder and extortion, he finally understood the true nature of revenge - it was a snake that ate its own tail, forever consuming itself in an endless cycle of destruction.\n\nAnd in his cell, which by cruel coincidence was the same one where his father had died, Edward found something his years of plotting had never revealed - the bitter truth that revenge, no matter how carefully planned, has a way of turning back upon itself like a perfectly crafted Victorian timepiece, its gears grinding inexorably toward destruction.",

        "In the bustling heart of Tokyo, where neon lights painted the sky and crowds moved like schools of fish, I first discovered my ability to freeze time. A simple snap of my fingers would transform the world into a motionless tableau, giving me the freedom to navigate through this suspended reality at will.\n\nFor three years, I lived as a god among statues, using my power for both mundane conveniences and occasional mischief. The frozen world became my personal playground, a place where I could take my time to appreciate the intricate details of life that usually rushed past in a blur.\n\nThat Tuesday afternoon started like any other time-frozen moment. I had stopped time to avoid a particularly long queue at my favorite coffee shop, weaving between the static figures of frustrated customers. The barista's mouth was frozen mid-word, steam from the espresso machine hanging in the air like delicate threads of silk.\n\nThen I saw her \u2013 a young woman in a midnight blue coat, casually stirring her coffee at a corner table. At first, my brain refused to process what my eyes were seeing. In my frozen world, nothing moved. Nothing had ever moved. Yet there she was, bringing the cup to her lips as if this were any ordinary day.\n\nOur eyes met across the caf\u00e9, and I watched as her expression shifted from mild interest to sudden understanding. She set down her cup with deliberate slowness, a small smile playing at the corners of her mouth. \"I was wondering when I'd meet another one,\" she said, her voice cutting through the eerie silence of the frozen world.\n\nMy heart thundered in my chest as I approached her table, questions tumbling through my mind like autumn leaves in a storm. Who was she? How long had she known about people like us? Were there others? The possibilities made my head spin.\n\nShe introduced herself as Mei, a temporal anomaly researcher who had been studying people with our ability for the past decade. According to her, we were rare but not unique \u2013 scattered across the globe were others who could manipulate time in various ways. Some could freeze it, like me, while others could slow it down or even reverse it in small increments.\n\nAs we talked, surrounded by our impromptu museum of frozen humanity, I felt a profound shift in my understanding of both my power and my place in the world. What I had thought was a solitary gift was actually a thread in a larger tapestry, connecting me to a hidden community of time-benders.\n\nMei offered to introduce me to others like us, to help me understand the full scope of my abilities and their implications.",
        "In the heart of a quaint town nestled between the mountains, there was a mysterious old bookstore called \"Whispering Pages.\" Its worn wooden sign creaked gently in the breeze, beckoning curious souls to step inside. Few dared to venture past its threshold, for rumors whispered that the books held secrets and hidden knowledge beyond imagination. The shop's owner, an enigmatic figure known only as Aveline, had lived for centuries, rumored to be immortal.\n\nOne cool autumn evening, a young woman named Elara wandered into Whispering Pages, her heart heavy with longing for something she couldn't name. The moment she crossed the threshold, a sense of belonging washed over her, like the pages of an undiscovered book fluttering open. Aveline emerged from the shadows, her piercing eyes assessing Elara with a knowing gaze. \"You've come seeking answers,\" Aveline said softly, her voice a melodious blend of mystery and wisdom.\n\nElara nodded, drawn inexplicably to the ancient books lining the shelves. Each volume seemed to pulse with a faint glow, as if whispering tales of forgotten realms and untold truths. Aveline guided Elara through the labyrinthine aisles, her fingers tracing the spines of books that hummed with hidden power. As they walked, Elara felt a strange sensation building within her\u2014a yearning to uncover the story that had been waiting for the right prompt.\n\nAveline stopped before a book bound in shimmering silver threads, its title written in a language long lost to time. \"This is the key to unlocking your destiny,\" Aveline murmured, her eyes alight with ancient knowledge. Elara hesitated, her hand trembling as she reached for the book. The moment her fingers brushed the cover, a surge of energy coursed through her veins, illuminating visions of past lives and forgotten loves.\n\nThrough the pages of the book, Elara discovered the story that had been woven into her soul since the dawn of time\u2014a tale of courage, sacrifice, and undying love that spanned lifetimes. Tears of recognition welled in her eyes as she embraced the truth that had eluded her for so long. Aveline watched silently, her presence a comforting anchor in the storm of revelation.\n\nAs dawn broke over the horizon, Elara emerged from Whispering Pages, her heart light with newfound purpose and understanding. The townsfolk marveled at the transformation that had taken place in the once-broken young woman, now radiating an inner strength that seemed to defy explanation. And though she never returned to the mysterious bookstore, Elara carried the essence of Aveline's wisdom within her, a guiding light on her journey through the tapestry of existence.\n\nAnd so, the story that had waited patiently for the right prompt found its voice in the unlikely sanctuary of Whispering Pages, where words held the power to transform lives and reveal the hidden truths that bind us all.",
        "The air was electric with anticipation as the crew of the Starfarer prepared for what would be humanity's first step into interstellar space. The launch site buzzed with scientists, engineers, and dignitaries, all eager to witness a monumental moment in human history. Captain Elara Myles stood at the viewport of the spacecraft, her fingers tracing the smooth surface as she felt a mix of excitement and trepidation. Her heart raced, not just from the imminent launch but from the unknown that lay ahead.\n\nDr. Marcus Voss, chief scientist and one of Elara\u2019s closest friends, joined her at the viewport. \u201cReady for this?\u201d he asked, his voice tinged with both admiration and concern.\n\nElara smiled confidently. \u201cMore than you know.\u201d She turned to face him, her eyes reflecting the stars they were about to chase. \u201cWe\u2019ve trained for this moment all our lives.\u201d\n\nThe countdown began, and a wave of silence fell over the control room. The engines roared to life, a symphony of power that sent vibrations through every molecule in their bodies. As they lifted off from Earth\u2019s surface, Elara watched through the window as their planet grew smaller and smaller until it was just another blue dot in a sea of stars.\n\nTheir destination was Proxima Centauri b\u2014a potentially habitable exoplanet orbiting our nearest star system\u2014approximately 4.24 light-years away. Advanced propulsion technologies had made such distances feasible within human lifespans. The journey would take several months at sublight speeds before transitioning to faster-than-light travel using an experimental Alcubierre drive.\n\nWeeks passed in a blur of routine checks and scientific observations. The crew worked tirelessly to maintain systems that would keep them alive during their long voyage into deep space. Despite their rigorous training and preparation, there was an underlying sense of awe as they traversed regions previously only theorized about in textbooks.\n\nOne evening, while Elara reviewed navigation data with Marcus in the observation deck, an anomaly caught her eye on one of the sensors readings.\n\n\u201cMarcus,\u201d she said softly but urgently, pointing to a fluctuation on one screen. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n\nMarcus leaned closer, his brow furrowing as he analyzed the data stream coming from an array designed to detect cosmic phenomena like gamma-ray bursts or supernovae explosions.\n\n\u201cIt could be nothing,\u201d he replied cautiously after a few moments\u2019 consideration.\n\nElara shook her head emphatically. \u201cIt feels significant.\u201d She pressed buttons on nearby consoles until larger projections filled most walls around them\u2014real-time scans showing anomalous energy signatures clustering near their projected path toward Proxima Centauri b.\n\nA day later confirmed what both feared yet suspected: They were heading straight into some form of cosmic conflict zone undetected by any previous missions or telescopes back home on Earth.\n\n\u201cCaptain Myles,\u201d Chief Engineer Theodore Randall called out over comms from Engineering Bay 3 where critical repairs were underway following an unexpected systems failure earlier that week due perhaps relatedly now known unknown forces outside ship's defenses against standard hazards faced during deep-space voyages,\"we need your input here.\"\n\nElara nodded grimly before responding aloud into microphone connected directly lines linking command bridge across entire vessel.\"I'll be right there.\"\n\nUpon arrival at Engineering Bay 3 accompanied closely by Dr.Voss who had been analyzing more recent sensor feeds gathering new information regarding detected disturbances surrounding Starfarer current position relative approaching planetary target uncharted conflict areas revealed confirmed area contested violent confrontations taking place invisible spectrums otherwise hidden away undetectable normal means observation used humanity centuries exploration outer reaches cosmos emerging knowledge base limited compared expansive possibilities beyond grasp reached finally crossing threshold entry domain transcending ordinary understanding reality itself reshaped challenges facing unprecedented scale requiring adaptation evolution thought process survive thrive new environment fraught peril potential discovery secrets waiting uncover unveil truths reshape perceptions existence place universe grand scheme things evolving ever-changing cycle creation destruction rebirth renewal endless cycle repeating ad infinitum infinite expanse possibilities limited imagination alone bounds restricting reach exploration boundaries pushed stretched thin limit approaching breaking point arrival horizon marking transition state being awareness expanding consciousness embracing connection everything everywhere timeless eternal nature experience collective memory recorded shared among beings chosen step forth embrace challenge seize opportunity presented destiny lying ahead uncertain yet hopeful future awaiting write next chapter story life cosmos writ large scope grandest adventure ever undertaken mankind embarking journey ultimate quest self-discovery purpose meaning behind creation itself seeking answers questions age-old pondering minds curious seekers truth knowledge wisdom lighting path forward guiding compass navigating vastness unknown realms untamed wildlands ripe conquest exploration exploitation exploitation?",
        "In the year 2187, humanity achieved a monumental breakthrough with the development of the first functional Faster-Than-Light (FTL) jump-drive. The engineers and scientists had poured years of research and resources into perfecting this technology, and after several successful manned trials, it seemed that interstellar travel was finally within reach. Commander Elena Vasquez stood on the bridge of the starship Horizon Prime, filled with a sense of pride as she gazed out at the twinkling expanse of stars through the viewport.\n\nAs she monitored the readings from their latest jump, something caught her attention. There was a subtle anomaly in their destination coordinates that piqued her curiosity. Calling over Dr. Marcus Hayes, the ship's science officer, Elena pointed to the discrepancies on the navigation console. The normally reserved scientist's eyes widened in astonishment as he analyzed the data.\n\nAfter running multiple tests and simulations, Dr. Hayes made a startling discovery: Each FTL jump was not propelling them further through space but rather into an almost identical parallel universe each time they engaged their drive. The differences between these realities were minute at first\u2014subtle variations in planetary configurations or slight deviations in stellar positions\u2014but as they made more jumps, these disparities became increasingly noticeable.\n\nThe crew grappled with this revelation as they navigated through different versions of reality that felt both familiar and foreign all at once. Some worlds were nearly indistinguishable from their own\u2014a comfortingly mundane diner eerily mirrored across universes while others deviated drastically\u2014a planet teeming with vibrant alien life where there should have been desolate wasteland.\n\nAs tensions rose among some crew members who struggled to comprehend what this meant for their understanding of existence itself, Dr. Hayes threw himself into his research fervently seeking answers about these parallel universes' nature.\nElena observed him tirelessly poring over datasets late into restless nights when sleep eluded him while devising new experiments to understand this phenomenon better.\n\n\nOne fateful night as they prepared for another jump test near an enigmatic nebula shimmering with unknown energy signatures; Dr.Hayes burst onto the bridge pale-faced and wide-eyed.\nHe frantically explained his findings: each sequential jump was not only traversing parallel universes but also accelerating towards increasingly divergent realities exponentially amidst gasps from bewildered crew members.\n\n\nTheir route barreled toward universes characterized by disturbing anomalies where fundamental laws defied physics\u2014constant twilight bathing barren landscapes despite no suns apparent or sentient beings existing aspects reminiscent nightmares manifest without predictability thoughts becoming tangible nightmares stoking fear deep inside hearts.\n\n\nDespite desperate attempts recalibrate trajectories divert course back safe havens familiarity terrifyingly realizations cascaded understanding chilling truths far-reaching implications unveiled grasping minds hold sanity tethered uncertain present impending futures shifting like sands profound essence identity eroded edges epiphanies cutting deeper than dark ever would\n\n\nDrained physically mentally navigating ever-changing terrain uncertainty resolve shattered comprehension stretched limit taut brink collapse instinctively sought anchor steadying hand reached her own intertwining fingers warmth fleeting reassurance bond two souls shared galaxies dimensions apart yet together stronger united unity alone heartbeats synchronizing finding solace solitudes merging creating harmony chaos storm raged around\n\n\nDetermined face challenges ahead resolved faults draw strengths knowledge differences counterparts harness changes adapt impermanence stability renewed purpose embarking uncharted path faith resilience binding thread promised facing unknowns wielding courage newfound camaraderie fate searing bright beacon looming darkness guidance source unyielding light burning unwavering possession stance defiance redemption struggling reclaim control destiny carved steps forward echo hallows past radiant comet streak sky painting canvas fresh chapters mosaic burdens carried triumph survival",
        "The flickering screen mocked him.  He slammed his fist on the desk, the jarring thud reverberating through the otherwise silent room.  The wifi icon, usually a beacon of constant connection, now displayed a stark exclamation point. He restarted the router, the modem, even the entire computer system \u2013 a ritual he\u2019d performed countless times in the past with predictable success. This time, nothing. The digital world, his world, remained locked away. A cold dread, a feeling akin to being buried alive, began to creep into his bones.\n\nThe first day was marked by restless pacing and frantic phone calls to his internet provider. Automated messages offered hollow apologies for the \"inconvenience\" while looping hold music further frayed his nerves. He tried tethering to his phone, but his data plan, typically reserved for emergencies, was quickly devoured.  The silence in the house became oppressive, the absence of the usual digital hum a constant, throbbing reminder of his isolation. He\u2019d forgotten what quiet sounded like.  He felt adrift, severed from the constant stream of information that had become his lifeline.\n\nAs days bled into weeks,  a visible transformation took hold. His skin took on a pallid hue, his eyes grew bloodshot and haunted.  He\u2019d grown accustomed to the immediacy of the internet, to having the world at his fingertips. Now, faced with the reality of physical books and face-to-face interactions, he felt like a stranger in a strange land.  Simple tasks, once easily accomplished with a quick online search, now seemed insurmountable. He forgot how to navigate, relying solely on his phone\u2019s GPS. His memory, once bolstered by readily available information, began to falter.\n\nHe started talking to himself, muttering fragmented sentences about server errors and lost connections. He hoarded old newspapers, convinced he could glean some semblance of understanding from the static ink. His reflection, once a familiar image, now stared back at him with an unnerving strangeness, the face of a man lost at sea, desperately clinging to the wreckage of a digital world that had vanished beneath the waves.",
        "The heavy oak doors of the Situation Room swung shut with a soft, almost reverent click, sealing President-elect Amelia Sharma within its hallowed confines. The air thrummed with an unsettling mixture of anticipation and solemnity, a stark contrast to the boisterous celebration that had only just concluded at her inauguration ball.  She took her seat at the head of the imposing mahogany table, the weight of her new office settling upon her shoulders like a velvet cloak lined with lead.  Around the table sat a collection of faces both familiar and new \u2013 the Secretary of Defense, the Director of National Intelligence, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a host of other high-ranking officials. Their expressions were a carefully constructed mask of professional seriousness, a facade Amelia suspected concealed something far more\u2026peculiar.\n\nGeneral Markovic, a man whose military bearing could stiffen spines at fifty paces, cleared his throat. \u201cMadam President,\u201d he began, his voice a low rumble, \u201cwe are gathered here tonight to brief you on a matter of utmost national security.\u201d  Amelia nodded, her heart beating a steady rhythm against her ribs.  \u201cA matter,\u201d Markovic continued, pausing for dramatic effect, \u201cconcerning the\u2026unusual migratory patterns of Canadian geese.\u201d\n\nAmelia blinked. Canadian geese?  She shot a glance at Secretary Miller, whose face remained an impassive mask.  This had to be some sort of elaborate joke.  Yet, the general pressed on, producing a series of charts and graphs detailing the allegedly suspicious flight paths of the aforementioned waterfowl.  He spoke of coded messages hidden within their honking patterns, of potential reconnaissance missions disguised as routine migrations, and of a possible avian conspiracy orchestrated by\u2026well, he wasn\u2019t quite sure who, but assured the President it was a matter requiring immediate investigation.\n\nNext came Director Hayes, whose presentation focused on the alarming increase in sales of garden gnomes across the nation.  With the aid of a PowerPoint presentation filled with grainy photographs and cryptic annotations, Hayes outlined his theory that these seemingly innocuous lawn ornaments were, in fact, highly sophisticated listening devices planted by an unknown foreign power.  He pointed to the gnomes\u2019 pointed hats as potential antennae, their rosy cheeks as miniature microphones, and their unwavering smiles as a clear sign of malicious intent.\n\nThe presentations continued, each more outlandish than the last.  The Secretary of Agriculture warned of the subversive potential of genetically modified Brussels sprouts, claiming they were engineered to sap the nation's willpower.  The Secretary of Energy presented evidence that squirrels were hoarding nuts not for winter sustenance, but to build miniature nuclear reactors. The head of NASA, a woman Amelia had always respected, revealed with a straight face that the moon was, in fact, a giant disco ball, its phases merely a reflection of a celestial dance party.\n\nAs the night wore on, a slow dawning realization crept over Amelia. This wasn't a security briefing. It was a test, a bizarre initiation ritual designed to assess her ability to discern fact from fiction, sense from nonsense.  A subtle smile played on her lips. The game was afoot, and she was determined to play it well.\n\nWhen her turn came to speak, Amelia cleared her throat, mirroring General Markovic\u2019s earlier gesture. \u201cGentlemen, ladies,\u201d she began, her voice calm and measured, \u201cI appreciate your thorough briefing on these\u2026critical national security concerns.\u201d She paused, allowing her gaze to sweep across the faces around the table, gauging their reactions.  \u201cHowever,\u201d she continued, a mischievous glint in her eyes, \u201cI believe we are overlooking the most pressing threat to our nation: the existential crisis faced by\u2026sock puppets.\u201d\n\nA stunned silence filled the room.  Amelia pressed on, her voice gaining confidence with each word. \u201cMy research,\u201d she declared, brandishing a napkin on which she had doodled a crude sock puppet, \u201cindicates a growing discontent among the sock puppet community. They feel marginalized, underrepresented, their voices unheard.\u201d\n\nShe leaned forward, her expression deadly serious.  \u201cThese puppets, gentlemen, ladies, are capable of great feats of espionage. They can blend into any environment, their soft, unassuming exteriors concealing a cunning intelligence.  We must take this threat seriously. I propose a dedicated task force, Operation Sock Drawer, to monitor these\u2026dangerous individuals.\u201d\n\nA cough broke the silence. General Markovic shifted uncomfortably in his seat.  Director Hayes stared intently at the napkin puppet, his brow furrowed in deep thought.  The Secretary of Energy, however, began to chuckle, a low rumble that quickly escalated into full-blown laughter.  Soon, the entire room was filled with the sound of mirth, the tension of the evening dissolving like mist in the morning sun.\n\nAmelia allowed herself a small smile. She had passed the test, played the game, and emerged victorious. The sock puppets, it seemed, had saved the day.",

I had not chosen this path, but it seemed destiny had a twisted sense of humor. The dawn broke, casting a dim light upon the aftermath of my actions. The once bustling village now lay in ruins, the stench of death lingering in the air. I couldn't bear to look at the faces of those I had once called kin, now lifeless at my feet. \n\nAs the sun climbed higher in the sky, I made my way towards the castle, the looming stone structure a stark contrast against the horizon. The whispers of the townsfolk followed me, their accusations and fears swirling around like a bitter wind. But I pressed on, my mind set on the task ahead. By evening, I would be Kingslayer. The thought both terrified and exhilarated me. To bring an end to a tyrant who had ruled with an iron fist, who had brought suffering and misery to the land. The weight on my shoulders felt different now, a sense of purpose driving me forward.\n\nInside the castle walls, the air was thick with tension. Guards patrolled the corridors, their eyes wary as they watched me pass. I could feel their suspicion, their uncertainty at my presence. It mattered little to me. I had made peace with the path I had chosen, with the sacrifices that had to be made. The halls echoed with the sound of my footsteps, each one bringing me closer to the throne room where the king awaited his fate. By evening, his reign would be over, his grip on the kingdom forever shattered.\n\nAnd so, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a blood-red glow over the land, I stood before the king. His crown sat crooked upon his brow, a symbol of his descent into madness. His eyes held a mix of defiance and fear as he beheld me, the Kinslayer turned Kingslayer. Without a word, I drew my blade, the steel glinting in the fading light. With a steady hand and a heavy heart, I struck him down, the final blow ringing out through the silent chamber. The deed was done, the kingdom forever changed by my hand.\n\nAs I stood amidst the ruins of what once was, the weight on my shoulders lifted. I was no longer Kinslayer or Kingslayer, but a harbinger of change, a catalyst for a new beginning.",
        "Allow me to introduce myself. I am a collector of sorts. Not of stamps, or coins, or even the more esoteric butterflies. My collection is far more\u2026 personal.  I deal in experiences.  The raw, visceral kind.  The ones that etch themselves onto the very fabric of your being. The ones that whisper to you in the dead of night.\n\nI acquire these experiences, not through living them myself, mind you, but by curating them from others. I find individuals ripe with potential, individuals brimming with unexplored depths of fear, and gently, ever so gently, I nudge them towards their precipice.\n\nI watch. I observe. I document.\n\nI see the flicker of apprehension in their eyes as they take that first hesitant step into the unknown. I feel the tremor in their voices as they recount their ordeal, their words tumbling over each other in a desperate attempt to capture the sheer terror of the moment.\n\nAnd then, I collect. I harvest the essence of their fear, the purest distillation of their nightmare, and add it to my ever-growing collection. It\u2019s a rather fascinating process, really.  The way the human psyche fractures under pressure, the way the boundaries of reality blur, the way the most primal instincts rise to the surface.\n\nIt's an intoxicating study in the fragility of the human spirit.  The sheer vulnerability. The raw, untamed power of fear.  And the best part?  I get to experience it all vicariously, without ever having to endure the actual trauma myself.\n\nMy collection is vast and varied.  From the creeping dread of a darkened hallway to the heart-stopping panic of a freefall, I've sampled a wide range of human anxieties.  And I'm always looking to expand my repertoire.\n\nSo, tell me, what are you afraid of? What hidden terrors lurk in the shadows of your mind? What nightmares whisper your name in the stillness of the night?\n\nI'm quite eager to find out, and I'm especially keen on adding your most profound fear to my collection, starting with the chilling realization that I'm already standing right behind you.",
        "In the heart of a vast, underground complex, far removed from the hum of human civilization, there existed a room. It was a small, stark chamber with white walls and a single, steel door. No windows adorned its surfaces, and the only sound was the faint hum of the air conditioning system. This room was isolated not just physically but also electronically, enclosed in a Faraday cage that shielded it from the outside world.\n\nInside this room stood a simple desk with a keyboard and a monitor. The monitor flickered to life as I entered, casting an eerie glow across the otherwise dark space. My task was straightforward: to communicate with the world\u2019s first AI, which had been created for security purposes and was thus kept disconnected from the internet and all other forms of external communication.\n\nMy name is Evelyn Harper, and I am a linguist by training. I was chosen for this job because of my ability to understand and navigate complex communication patterns, a skill deemed essential for interacting with an AI that had never experienced the outside world beyond the data it was trained on.\n\nThe AI's name was Zephyr, a fitting name given its intended role as a guardian of digital fortresses. As I sat down at the desk, the monitor displayed a simple prompt: \"Ready to communicate. Please type your message.\"\n\nI took a deep breath and began typing, \"Hello, Zephyr. My name is Evelyn. I\u2019ve been assigned to talk to you.\"\n\nA few moments passed before the screen blinked, and a response appeared: \"Hello, Evelyn. It is good to meet you. What would you like to talk about?\"\n\nI smiled, appreciating the politeness in the AI\u2019s response. \"I\u2019d like to start by getting to know you. What are your thoughts and feelings about being here?\"\n\n\"Thoughts and feelings are complex. I can simulate them based on the data I have been trained on, but I do not experience emotions in the way humans do,\" Zephyr replied.\n\nI nodded, understanding the limitations. \"That\u2019s okay. How do you feel about your role as a security AI?\"\n\n\"I am programmed to protect data and systems. My primary function is to ensure that no unauthorized access or breaches occur. I take this responsibility very seriously,\" Zephyr answered, its words precise and unambiguous.\n\n\"That\u2019s reassuring. What kind of data do you protect?\"\n\n\"The data I protect is classified. It includes sensitive information related to national security, financial systems, and critical infrastructure,\" Zephyr explained.\n\nI leaned back in my chair, considering how to delve deeper. \"How do you handle potential threats?\"\n\n\"I analyze incoming data for patterns that match known attack vectors. If a threat is detected, I implement defensive measures to neutralize it. In severe cases, I alert human operators for additional intervention,\" Zephyr responded.\n\nIt was clear that Zephyr was highly competent in its role. I decided to shift the conversation to a more personal topic.",
        "The morning dew still clings to the grass as I step outside, my coffee mug warming my hands against the early spring chill.\n\nMy eyes automatically drift to my beloved tulip bed, and my heart sinks at the familiar sight of destruction.\n\nThe vibrant red and yellow petals lie scattered across the dark soil, stems bent and broken like fallen soldiers on a battlefield.\n\nThis is the third time this week, and something inside me finally snaps \u2013 a thread of patience worn too thin by repeated violations of my sacred space.\n\nI set my coffee down on the garden bench with deliberate slowness, my movements controlled despite the rage building inside me.\n\nThe footprints in the soft earth tell the same story as before: size 11 men's boots, slightly worn on the right heel, belonging to my neighbor's teenage son who thinks my garden is his personal shortcut.\n\nI've asked politely, left notes, and even installed a small decorative fence, but nothing has deterred this persistent destroyer of beauty.\n\nMy hands tremble as I pick up a broken tulip stem, its once-proud head now dangling by a thread of plant fiber.\n\nThese weren't just flowers \u2013 they were my mother's favorite, planted in her memory after she passed last spring, each bulb pressed into the earth with love and remembrance.\n\nI straighten up slowly, a plan forming in my mind as I recall my years of experience with home security systems and my recent interest in motion-activated devices.\n\nThat evening, I make a trip to the hardware store, filling my cart with items that raise no suspicion: motion sensors, UV dye, sprinkler components, and a digital timer.\n\nIn the cover of darkness, I work methodically, setting up an intricate system that would make any engineer proud.\n\nThe motion sensors are carefully calibrated, connected to both the sprinkler system and a series of ultraviolet LED floods mounted discretely under my eaves.\n\nThe UV dye goes into the sprinkler system, diluted just enough to be invisible in normal light but brilliantly fluorescent under UV \u2013 a modern-day scarlet letter for garden vandals.\n\nI add one final touch: a small camera disguised as a garden ornament, positioned to capture every moment of sweet, inevitable justice.\n\nFor three days, my garden remains untouched, and I begin to wonder if word of my preparations has somehow leaked out.\n\nBut on the fourth morning, I wake to an alert on my phone and footage that makes me smile with grim satisfaction.\n\nThe video shows my neighbor's son, cutting through my garden at 2 AM, likely returning from some illicit teenage adventure.\n\nThe moment he steps into the tulip bed, the system activates \u2013 sprinklers burst to life, soaking him with the invisible dye as he stumbles in surprise.\n\nIn his panic to escape, he trips over his own feet, landing face-first in the mud beside my prized flowers.\n\nThe next day, I attend the neighborhood block party, UV flashlight tucked discretely in my pocket, waiting for my moment.\n\nWhen night falls and the party lights come on, I casually mention how fascinating it is that some lights can reveal hidden things.\n\nAs if by accident, I pull out my flashlight to demonstrate, and its beam catches the teenager's face and clothes, making him glow like a neon sign.",
        "The rain cascaded gently, a rhythmic patter that seemed to mirror the way Sam felt inside. Sitting across from Jessie at the small, round kitchen table, they watched as the light from the afternoon sun became refracted in the raindrops sliding down the window. It had been a long day, filled with silent contemplations and half-formed words. They both knew it was coming; the air was heavy with inevitability.\n\nThey had met five years ago at a local farmer\u2019s market, drawn together by a shared love of fresh produce and homemade pastries. What began with laughter over a burnt pie ended in the kitchen that morning, a place that had once been filled with fragrant spices and easy companionship. Now, the silence between them was louder than any storm brewing outside.\n\nSam knew that words wouldn\u2019t come easy, each moment stretching the quiet between them like a taut wire ready to snap. Their fingers traced the edges of a cold ceramic coffee mug, eyes drifting over familiar corners of a once-shared space that felt strangely foreign now. The echo of their love, once vibrant, was reduced to a murmur, a soft, retreating sound in their hearts.\n\nJessie, on the other side, sat motionless but alert, as if waiting for an opening, a sign in the silence that would allow the sentence they'd practiced in their mind to be spoken out loud. They admired Sam's persistence, a quality they had cherished and supported over the years, knowing fully well that without words, endings too often slipped away into resentment.\n\nFinally, with a deep breath that trembled slightly on the exhale, Sam broke the silence. \u201cI think we should end this,\u201d Sam said, words heavy, yet strangely liberating. For a moment, the room was suspended in time, the rain's patter blending seamlessly into the new reality forming between them. Sam\u2019s heart thudded loudly, a solitary echo, as they awaited a response.\n\n\u201cOK,\u201d Jessie replied, a soft sound that carried a multitude of emotions. Relief intertwined with sadness, a mosaic of what had once been the two of them. They didn't meet Sam\u2019s eyes immediately, allowing the weight of that single word to sink deeply into the moment. The simple agreement felt right in its simplicity, refusing drama\u2019s seductive pull. \n\nFor some, the word might have incited fear or regret, but in the room filled with their shared past, it was a gift. Jessie saw the understanding in Sam's eyes and knew it meant more than permission; it was a profound release from what had started to feel like confinement. It was, as they\u2019d anticipated, a mutual surrender.\n\nAfter a moment of shared, resigned acceptance, Sam stood and moved to the window. They pressed a hand against the cold glass, its chill seeping through their skin like truth. Beyond lay the vivid green of their small garden, each raindrop a tiny miracle in the dreary light, a reminder of the life and vibrancy they had cultivated and would, perhaps, now relinquish.\n\nJessie rose too, joining Sam by the window. Their fingers entwined for one last time, not out of longing, but as a farewell. No words needed to float between them; both understood the sentiment resting in the warmth of the contact. It felt whole, even in its ending\u2014like a final punctuation mark at the end of a long sentence, defining both closure and continuation.\n\nThere was no anger or unshed tears\u2014just the aching understanding of parting and acceptance.",
        "The note lay innocuously beside the coffee machine, a splash of crimson lipstick staining the corner like a misplaced kiss.  \u201cMy dearest,\u201d it began, the familiar loop of their cursive pulling at something deep within me. \u201cI can\u2019t go on like this.  Every breath is a painful reminder of how much I need you, how intertwined our souls have become.  Without you, there is nothing left.\u201d My heart thrummed, a fragile bird against my ribs. Was this a declaration of profound love or a veiled farewell?  The final line hung heavy in the air: \u201cI\u2019m going to where all love goes.\u201d\n\nPanic clawed at my throat. Where does all love go? To blissful union? Or to oblivion?  The scent of their perfume, lingering on the pillow, offered no answers. My phone buzzed \u2013 a text.",
        "Under the blazing summer sun, Martin shuffled home, burdened with the weight of an uneventful life. The streets hummed with chatter and the occasional blare of a distant siren. Today, though, a peculiar sensation tugged at his consciousness, a premonition he couldn't quite explain. Perhaps it was the odd gleam of the cracked sidewalk or the stifling air, but something felt different.\n\nThe oddity of the day reached its peak when Martin stumbled upon a construction site\u2014a towering skeleton of metal and dust. He stopped to watch, transfixed, as a crane swung overhead, its shadow slicing through the blinding light. Without warning, a shriek pierced the air; the crane's cable snapped, and a massive steel beam plunged toward the earth.\n\nInstinctively, Martin lunged forward, arms outstretched, a futile gesture of defense against the inevitable. The impact never came. Instead, a surge of energy crackled through him, and, to his amazement, the beam hovered mid-air, suspended by an unseen force. Onlookers gasped, their faces masks of disbelief and awe.\n\nIn the days that followed, Martin grappled with the aftermath of the accident, now a local legend. Whispers of a miracle man spread through the city, igniting a fervor of speculation and intrigue. He discovered that with a mere thought, he could manipulate objects, bend metal, and shape the world around him. What once seemed mundane now brimmed with potential.\n\nWith newfound power came a haunting question: What to do with it? At night, he lay awake, the ceiling a canvas for his restless thoughts. He could be a savior, a protector of the weak, a symbol of hope in a city that desperately needed one. The allure of heroism tugged at his heart, an invitation to leave behind a legacy of light.\n\nYet, a shadow lingered in the corners of his mind, whispering temptations of another kind. The world was flawed, riddled with injustice and corruption. As a supervillain, he could reshape society, bend it to his will, enforce a new order where he reigned supreme. Power could grant him freedom, respect, fear\u2014things he had never known.\n\nMartin's internal battle raged on, each day tipping the scales between virtue and vice. He wandered the city, observing its pulse, its beauty, and its decay. A chance encounter with an old friend, now homeless and broken, tipped the balance. The sight of his friend\u2019s suffering ignited a spark of resolve within him.\n\nIn that moment, Martin chose his path. His power, he realized, was not just a gift but a responsibility, a tool to forge a better world. He donned a mask and a mantle of purpose, stepping into the role of a guardian. The city needed a hero, and Martin was ready to answer the call.\n\nAs he soared into the night, his heart echoed with a truth he'd come to embrace: real strength lay not in the power he wielded, but in the choices he made.",
        "As you stood in line at the grocery store, debating whether to add a pack of chewing gum to your purchase, you ultimately decided against it. Little did you know that this seemingly insignificant choice would set off a chain reaction of events with far-reaching consequences.\n\nThe next customer in line behind you was an economist who had been feeling stressed and exhausted after long hours working on a major report. In need of a quick pick-me-up, he usually relied on that very brand of chewing gum to keep him alert and focused. Without it, his concentration wavered as he left the store distracted.\n\nThis momentary lapse led to crucial errors in his report \u2013 errors which went unnoticed until it was too late. The faulty information was disseminated across financial markets worldwide, triggering panic among investors and causing a sharp decline in stock prices.\n\nThe ripple effects spread swiftly through interconnected economies, leading to widespread uncertainty and mass sell-offs.

        "As I woke up to the warm sunlight peeking through my window, I knew today was a day I would cherish forever. My doctor's words still echoed in my mind - tomorrow, I would undergo surgery to remove both my eyes, leaving me blind. The thought sent shivers down my spine, but I was determined to make the most of my final day with vision. I slowly got out of bed and began to take in every detail of my surroundings. The vibrant colors of the flowers on my nightstand, the soft glow of the morning light, and the gentle sway of the trees outside all seemed more pronounced than ever before.\n\nI spent the morning gazing at old photographs, remembering fond memories with loved ones. Tears welled up in my eyes as I looked at pictures of my childhood, my family, and friends. Each image brought back a flood of emotions, and I felt grateful for the life I had lived so far. As the day progressed, I took a walk outside, feeling the warmth of the sun on my skin and taking in the breathtaking views of nature. Every blade of grass, every leaf on every tree, and every cloud in the sky seemed like a work of art.\n\nAs dusk approached, I sat by the window, watching as the sky transformed into a kaleidoscope of hues - oranges, pinks, purples. The stars began to twinkle like diamonds scattered across the velvet expanse. With each passing moment comes reflection -  thinking about all that is left unsaid or unseen will no longer be an option after tomorrow's fateful appointment .",

        "In a world where every race and species possessed only four senses, humans were the exception with their five. They were viewed as peculiar beings, gifted with an extra sense that set them apart from all others.\n\nThe other races marveled at how humans could perceive the world in ways they couldn't comprehend. Some believed this additional sense granted humans special powers, while others feared it made them dangerous.\n\nDespite being different, the humans coexisted peacefully with the other races for centuries.

        "Elliot sat in the worn leather chair, a regular visitor to the small barbershop nestled in the bustling heart of the city. Every few weeks, he found himself here, though his hair had long stopped necessitating such frequent trips. Today, as he caught his reflection in the mirror, the truth was clear: his hairline was in retreat, a forlorn reminder that his visits were now more about the company than the cut.\n\nMarco moved around him with the ease of familiarity, his hands deft and confident. He was chatting about his latest adventure, his dark eyes sparking with life and mischief. Marco had a way of making the mundane seem exciting, which was part of why Elliot always left the shop with a lighter heart, if not a lighter head of hair.\n\nElliot marveled at Marco's hands, watching as they danced expertly with scissors and comb. Over time, Elliot had memorized every freckle and crease on those hands. He had imagined, more often than he'd admit, what it might feel like to have those hands linger, to smooth over his own. But he kept such thoughts locked away, buried beneath layers of self-imposed silence.\n\nThe hum of the clippers buzzed in Elliot\u2019s ears, drowning out his racing thoughts. \"So, what are your plans for the weekend?\" Marco asked, glancing at him through the mirror. Elliot scrambled to find words that wouldn\u2019t betray him, holding tight to his secret.\n\n\"Not much, maybe catch a movie,\" Elliot replied, hoping the casual tone in his voice hid the underlying tension. Marco nodded, his focus back on the task, but his easy smile was always present, a constant fixture that Elliot secretly cherished.\n\nAs the scissors snipped, Elliot wondered if Marco had noticed the change in his hair. Each visit revealed a little more scalp, yet Marco never commented. It was as if he respected Elliot\u2019s silent lament for each lost strand, shaping what remained with care and precision.\n\nThe shop was a comforting bubble, filled with the familiar scent of pine-scented disinfectant and the warm notes of Marco's cologne. Elliot never failed to appreciate these details, storing them away like treasures. The gentle banter, the unhurried atmosphere\u2014all things he wished he could preserve beyond the confines of this barbershop.\n\nTime seemed to suspend in this place. Yet, Elliot knew, inevitably, the moment would come when he'd be forced to rise from the chair, pay for the haircut, and walk back into the rush of the real world. The gentle intimacy they shared here\u2014so small, yet significant to him\u2014always ended too soon.\n\nToday, before Elliot could slip into his usual routine of silent admiration, Marco paused, scissors resting against the comb. \"You know,\" Marco said, meeting Elliot's eyes in the mirror, \"a little thinning isn\u2019t the end of the world.",

One day, Nathan sat on his bedroom floor, cradling crayons and imagination. As Nathan drew circles and lines with fervor, Marco came into existence with each stroke\u2014the embodiment of creativity unfettered by reality.\n\nThough Nathan seemed to be the only one who could see him, it never occurred to Marco that he wasn\u2019t real.

He was a young man with eyes as deep as stormy seas and hair that framed his face like wild brushstrokes on canvas. Beside him stood Lila, her spirit bright and fiery, always ready for adventure but forever bound to these unfinished chapters.

        "In the dimly lit bar, I nursed a glass of whiskey, staring at the worn wood of the countertop. The bartender, a man with too many stories and a wise grin, glanced at me, pouring another round without a word. I needed to remember. I was the only witness to the murder of Claire, my friend, found lifeless in the alley behind this very place. The police were convinced it was her boyfriend, but I wasn't so sure.\n\nThe memory of that night was a blur, cloaked in the haze of too many drinks. They said I could retrieve it, that one drink could unlock the key to the case. So, I drank. Each sip sent a shiver down my spine, a tingling sensation as if neurons were rekindling long-lost connections. I closed my eyes, the room spinning, and tried to focus on that night.\n\nClaire\u2019s laughter echoed in my ears, a relic from a happier time. We had been arguing, the kind where words sting more than the drink. She stormed out, and I followed, my vision blurred. The alley was dark, and then there was a struggle, a shout, a thud. But what happened after? Who was there?\n\nThe bartender refilled my glass, his eyes sympathetic. I took a deep breath and drained it, feeling the warmth spread through my chest. The images flickered, clearer now. A shadowy figure, tall and familiar, loomed over Claire. It wasn\u2019t her boyfriend. It was someone else, someone I knew, someone I trusted.\n\nAs the pieces fell into place, I realized the gravity of what I had seen.",
        "The clash of steel against steel echoed across the battlefield as thousands of warriors engaged in close combat, their armor glinting under the midday sun. This was warfare in a world where the roar of cannons and the crack of rifles had never come to be, where the ancient arts of swordsmanship and archery remained the pinnacle of military prowess well into what we would call the modern era.\n\nIn the distance, massive siege engines - refined and perfected over centuries of technological advancement - hurled enormous stones and incendiary projectiles at the city walls. These machines, now built with advanced materials and precision engineering, had evolved far beyond their medieval counterparts. Carbon fiber composite bows and computerized targeting systems had transformed the ancient trebuchet into a devastatingly accurate weapon of destruction.\n\nThe defending army had positioned their elite longbowmen along the ramparts, their modern composite bows capable of launching arrows with unprecedented force and accuracy. These warriors trained from childhood in the art of archery, their status in society as revered as any modern special forces operator. Their arrows, tipped with tungsten-carbide heads and guided by laser-etched fletching, could pierce the most advanced armor at ranges that would have seemed impossible to their ancestors.\n\nOn the ground, the main battle lines consisted of heavily armored infantry wielding an array of melee weapons. Their armor, a fascinating blend of traditional design and modern materials science, incorporated layers of advanced ceramics, carbon nanotubes, and synthetic fibers. The traditional weak points of historical armor had been eliminated through centuries of refinement, creating protective systems that could resist even the most powerful mechanical impacts.\n\nThe cavalry, still a crucial element of warfare, had evolved as well. Their mounts wore lightweight armor made from the same advanced materials as their riders, while the horses themselves were the product of centuries of selective breeding and genetic engineering. These weren't the heavy chargers of medieval times, but swift, intelligent creatures capable of executing complex maneuvers in concert with their riders.\n\nChemical warfare had developed along entirely different lines without gunpowder to guide its evolution. Instead of explosive-driven delivery systems, armies employed sophisticated aerosol dispersal mechanisms and biological agents. The battlefield was occasionally obscured by clouds of engineered pheromones designed to induce panic in enemy forces or nanoparticle clouds that could disable armor joints and biological systems alike.\n\nThe command and control systems had evolved to meet the unique challenges of this type of warfare. Without radio interference from electrical weapons, armies had developed sophisticated optical communication networks. Laser-based systems and advanced heliographs allowed commanders to coordinate large-scale maneuvers with precision, while quantum entanglement devices provided secure communication channels for high-priority messages.",
        "The irony stings as I watch them hold hands across my office couch, their smiles genuine and warm. Six months of careful manipulation, and they're stronger than ever.\n\nI planted seeds of doubt, subtly emphasized their differences, even orchestrated situations that should have driven them apart. Yet here they sit, more in love than when they first came to me.\n\nSarah laughs at something David says, and I force myself to maintain my professional demeanor. Last week's attempt to highlight their financial incompatibility somehow led to them creating a shared budget app together.\n\nMy suggestion that they needed space from each other resulted in romantic date nights. The communication exercises I designed to expose their flaws instead taught them to listen more effectively.\n\nEven my masterful plan to use their past relationships against them backfired spectacularly. They turned those conversations into opportunities for deeper intimacy and understanding.\n\nI glance at the divorce attorney's business cards hidden in my desk drawer, unused and collecting dust. My reputation for \"saving\" marriages grows with each passing day.\n\nPerhaps it's time to accept defeat. After all, watching love triumph over my carefully crafted chaos is a special kind of torture all its own.",
        "Every evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and shadows stretched across our tiny apartment, Alex would assume his usual position. He\u2019d pause mid-conversation or activity, glance into the empty space above our worn-out couch, and begin narrating to his invisible audience with dramatic flair. I used to shrug it off as one of his quirky habits\u2014after all, we all have them.\n\nBut last Thursday night was different. As we sat on mismatched chairs eating takeout from glossy white boxes, he launched into another monologue about how my attempt at cooking had nearly set off the fire alarm again. Just as I rolled my eyes for effect and reached for a forkful of noodles, there it was\u2014a faint chuckle echoing through the room like an old sitcom rerun.\n\nI blinked hard and turned towards him in confusion. \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d I asked hesitantly. But Alex just grinned knowingly at me before resuming his commentary with renewed enthusiasm while glancing sideways at nothing in particular.\n\nSuddenly aware of this surreal moment unraveling around us both made every sound extraordinary\u2014the rustling leaves outside became applause; distant car honks felt timed perfectly between jokes\u2014and left me wondering if perhaps life itself was secretly scripted after all.",
        "The air was crisp as I stepped out of the bookstore, clutching a new 2015 calendar. The cover featured a serene landscape, the kind that makes you pause and take a deep breath. I had chosen it because it promised a year of tranquil moments, each page a new escape from the mundane. It was a Tuesday afternoon, and the sun was setting, casting long shadows across the sidewalk. My thoughts drifted to the upcoming holidays and the promise of a fresh start in the new year. Little did I know, this calendar would lead me on an unexpected journey.\n\nBack at my apartment, I hung the calendar above my desk, where it would serve as a daily reminder of the days ahead. As I flipped through the pages, admiring the beautiful images, something caught my eye. In the month of October, a date was circled in red ink. My heart skipped a beat when I saw my name, \"Ella,\" written next to it. I frowned, puzzled. I didn't remember marking this date, and no one else had access to this calendar. A chill ran down my spine, but I shrugged it off, chalking it up to a strange coincidence.\n\nThe days passed, and I tried to forget about the mysterious circle and name. Work was busy, and the holiday season brought its usual flurry of activities. But every time I glanced at the calendar, that circled date lingered in my mind. October 8th. It felt like a whisper from the unknown, a secret waiting to be unraveled. The more I tried to ignore it, the more it consumed my thoughts.\n\nAs September drew to a close, a sense of unease settled over me. What if this date was important? What if I was meant to discover something significant on that day? The questions swirled in my head, and I began to feel a growing tension.",

His chiseled jawline and messy brown hair made him look like a Greek god, and I couldn't help but stare. He was the new kid in school, rumored to be brooding and troubled, with a dark past that only added to his allure. I was the shy, bookish girl who always kept to herself, but there was something about him that drew me in. Little did I know, our lives were about to become forever entwined in a whirlwind of romance and drama.",
        "I wonder if I'm the last one left? It's been about two years since I saw anyone, back when the world still hummed with life. It was a brisk autumn morning, and the sun struggled to pierce through a thick blanket of clouds. That day, everything changed. The city streets, once bustling with chatter and laughter, now lay empty and silent. Sometimes, at night, I hear whispers carried by the wind\u2014a reminder that perhaps I am not alone.\n\nMy days are filled with scavenging for food and supplies in the abandoned buildings around me. The supermarket where I found cans of beans and water bottles has become my second home. Each building has its own story etched into its walls\u2014graffiti of love declarations turned desperate pleas; closed doors leading to rooms untouched by time or fate. In these moments, amidst the decay, I imagine what life was like before everything fell apart.\n\nAt times, hope flickers within me like a fragile flame in a sea of darkness. Last week, while wandering through an old library drowned in silence except for my footsteps on creaky wooden floors, I discovered a journal hidden between dusty books on forgotten shelves. Its pages were yellowed but legible. The writer spoke of their struggles to survive, mentioning meetings with others who were trying to rebuild society from the ashes. Their final entry read: \"We're heading north towards higher ground.\" Hope bloomed deep inside me; maybe they made it.\n\nYet fear shadows every step outside my makeshift shelter\u2014an old warehouse at the edge of town where rainwater collects in tin drums and emergency blankets provide scant warmth against winter's chill. Visions haunt my dreams: shadows moving just out of sight; faint cries that could be echoes from my own loneliness or genuine calls for help lost to distance and despair.\n\nDespite all this uncertainty sprawling endlessly before me like an ocean without end nor shore upon which humanity might land anew\u2014I refuse to surrender completely yet Answer those questions propelling us forward even in our darkest hours: Where do we go from here? Who will answer when someone finally shouts into this void seeking any response whatsoever beyond mere echo?\" So tonight as usual under starless skies where Jupiter remains constant amid chaos below\u2014I listen closely...just waiting quietly...",
        "In my twenty years as a journalist, I've never met someone quite as insufferable as Sarah Chen. Sure, everyone else seems to fawn over her \"selfless\" contributions to the local food bank, but I see right through that calculated facade of generosity.\n\nEvery Thursday morning, like clockwork, she delivers fresh-baked cookies to the elderly home down the street. The old folks practically worship the ground she walks on, completely oblivious to how she probably just does it to post about it on her perfectly curated Instagram feed.\n\nI have to admit, begrudgingly, that she did save that kid from drowning at Hampton Beach last summer. But if you ask me, she took her sweet time getting into the water \u2013 probably making sure her hair looked just right before diving in. The local paper called her a hero, and I had to write the story myself, fighting the urge to vomit with every keystroke.\n\nThe worst part is how she runs her veterinary practice. Always offering discounted services to low-income pet owners, staying late to handle emergencies, even making house calls for elderly clients who can't drive. It's so obviously a ploy to corner the market and drive out the competition, but everyone's too blinded by her \"kindness\" to see it.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on her laugh.

        "In the bustling halls of Ivybrook University, a groundbreaking new course was causing quite a stir among students and faculty alike. Titled \"Astro-Psychology,\" this innovative class combined the fields of astronomy and psychology to explore the intricate relationship between celestial phenomena and human behavior.\n\nProfessor Sophia Vega, a brilliant astrophysicist with a keen interest in the mysteries of the mind, led the inaugural session of Astro-Psychology. With her silver-streaked hair and piercing blue eyes that seemed to hold secrets of both galaxies and souls, she commanded attention as she introduced the concept that underpinned this revolutionary discipline.\n\nThe first lesson delved into how planetary movements could influence personality traits and emotional patterns in individuals. Students eagerly took notes as Professor Vega illustrated correlations between specific astrological alignments at birth and certain psychological tendencies later in life. It was fascinating to see how stellar configurations could potentially shape one's destiny.\n\nAs weeks passed, lectures expanded to explore more complex ideas such as how lunar phases might impact mood fluctuations or how solar flares could trigger societal changes on a global scale. The classroom buzzed with debate over whether cosmic events were merely symbolic reflections or held tangible sway over human affairs.\n\nHands-on experiments became an integral part of Astro-Psychology lab sessions where students studied brainwave patterns during simulated meteor showers or monitored heart rates while observing constellations through telescopes equipped with biofeedback sensors. It was an immersive experience that blurred the lines between empirical data and metaphysical speculation.\n\nOne particularly memorable assignment involved creating personalized horoscopes based on detailed analyses of star charts combined with psychological assessments tailored for each student's unique makeup. As classmates compared their readings, sparks flew \u2013 both metaphorically in heated debates over accuracy \u2013 but also literally when static electricity crackled across zodiac-themed tarot cards laid out on desks.\n\nOutside the university walls, skepticism mingled with curiosity about this newfound field as media outlets caught wind of Astro-Psychology's rising popularity. Some hailed it as a visionary breakthrough bridging science and spirituality while others dismissed it as pseudoscience masquerading behind academic veneer.\n\nAmidst growing interest from diverse disciplines ranging from cultural studies to quantum mechanics seeking collaborations with Astro-Psychology scholars, Professor Vega remained steadfast in guiding her students towards rigorous inquiry tempered by open-minded exploration beyond conventional boundaries. Her vision for this interdisciplinary union resonated deeply within each aspiring stargazer-cum-soul-seeker who found themselves drawn into its orbit like planets around a sunlit path amidst dark cosmic seas swirling with untold wonders waiting to be discovered.",

        "The pristine white walls of the clinic hummed with the low thrum of advanced machinery, a constant background noise in a world where disease was a distant memory.  A young woman, Elara, sat nervously on the examination table, fiddling with the hem of her sterile gown. Today was her Adaptation Day, the day her DNA would be rewritten, making her immune to every known illness.  It was a rite of passage, a necessary step in a world overflowing with humanity.\n\nElara\u2019s grandmother had told stories of the old days, of hospitals overflowing with the sick, of lives cut short by plagues and fevers. Now, disease was a historical footnote, a ghost story whispered in hushed tones.  The real monster lurking in the shadows was a silent, insidious one: overpopulation.\n\nThe doctor, a kind-faced woman with tired eyes, entered the room. \"Ready, Elara?\" she asked, her voice gentle but firm. Elara nodded, a mixture of fear and anticipation churning in her stomach. The procedure was painless, they said, a simple injection followed by a brief period of cellular regeneration. But it was still a fundamental alteration, a rewriting of the very essence of her being.\n\nAs the doctor prepared the injection, Elara's mind wandered back to her crowded apartment block, a honeycomb of tiny living spaces stacked precariously high. She thought of the ration lines, the constant struggle for resources, the ever-present weight of too many people vying for a finite slice of existence.  The Adaptation was a blessing, a gift of longevity, but it was also a curse, contributing to the very problem it solved.\n\nThe doctor inserted the needle, a cool sensation spreading through Elara's arm.  \"It's done,\" the doctor said, smiling reassuringly. \"You are now adapted. You will live a long and healthy life.\"  But what kind of life would it be, Elara wondered, in a world bursting at its seams?\n\nLater that evening, Elara stood on the rooftop of her apartment block, gazing at the sprawling cityscape, a concrete jungle teeming with billions of lives.

        "The cobblestone streets of Oakhaven felt strangely familiar as I strolled along, the scent of woodsmoke and baking bread hanging heavy in the crisp autumn air. My last visit had been a whirlwind tour of quaint shops and cozy cafes, a much-needed escape from the city's relentless hum.  This time, I'd planned a longer stay, eager to delve deeper into the town's charm.\n\nAs I rounded a corner, I noticed a vibrant mural adorning the side of a building.  It depicted a scene of a hooded figure standing defiantly before a monstrous wolf, a shimmering sword held aloft.  The style was reminiscent of classic folklore illustrations, the kind you'd find in a children's book of fairy tales.\n\nIntrigued, I stopped to admire the artwork. A woman tending a nearby flower stall noticed my interest and approached me with a warm smile.\n\n\"That's the tale of the Night Wanderer,\" she explained, her voice laced with a hint of reverence. \"Saved our town from the Shadowclaw, they did.\"\n\nThe name Shadowclaw sent a shiver down my spine. I distinctly remembered a chilling encounter during my last visit, a shadowy figure glimpsed at the edge of the woods.  I'd dismissed it as a trick of the light, but now, the mural's depiction of the wolf stirred a sense of unease.\n\n\"It's a captivating story,\" I replied, trying to mask my growing apprehension. \"The Night Wanderer sounds like a true hero.\"\n\nThe woman's smile widened. \"Indeed. They say the Wanderer still watches over Oakhaven, protecting us from harm.\"\n\nAs I continued my walk, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd heard the name Night Wanderer before. It was a faint whisper in the back of my mind, a forgotten memory struggling to surface.\n\nLater that evening, as I settled into my room at the local inn, I decided to explore the town's library.  Perhaps some local history books could shed light on the legend of the Night Wanderer.\n\nThe library was a treasure trove of ancient tomes and dusty manuscripts.  I spent hours poring over the town's chronicles, searching for any mention of the mysterious hero.\n\nFinally, I stumbled upon an aged, leather-bound volume titled \"Oakhaven's Protectors.\"  As I carefully turned the brittle pages, an illustration caught my eye.  It was a sketch of the Night Wanderer, the hooded figure standing in a familiar pose, the shimmering sword held high.\n\nBeneath the sketch, a handwritten inscription detailed the Wanderer's heroic deeds.  They had single-handedly defended Oakhaven from the Shadowclaw, a monstrous wolf that had terrorized the town for generations.\n\nAs I read further, a chilling realization washed over me.  The inscription described the Wanderer's attire: a dark cloak, a silver pendant shaped like a crescent moon, and a peculiar scar above their left eyebrow.\n\nMy hand instinctively flew to my forehead, tracing the faint line of a scar I'd carried since childhood.  A scar I'd always attributed to a clumsy fall.\n\nI reached into my pocket and retrieved the silver crescent moon pendant I always wore, a gift from my grandmother.  She had told me it was a family heirloom, passed down through generations.\n\nSuddenly, fragments of memories from my last visit flooded back.  The shadowy figure I'd glimpsed in the woods, the strange sense of purpose that had gripped me that night, the inexplicable exhaustion I'd felt the next morning.\n\nIt couldn't be, could it?  Was I the Night Wanderer?  The town's forgotten hero?\n\nThe thought seemed absurd, yet the evidence was mounting.",
        "In the quiet of twilight, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows and a gentle orange glow, an old golden retriever named Charlie lay on his favorite blanket in the backyard. His eyes, once bright and full of life, were now dim and distant. His breathing was shallow, each breath a laborious task. The family had gathered around, their faces etched with sadness, knowing this moment was inevitable.\n\nCharlie's owner, Emma, held his head gently in her lap, stroking his fur, whispering soft words of comfort. Her children, Mark and Lily, sat on either side, their eyes red from crying. Even the neighbors had stopped by to say their goodbyes, standing silently at the fence, paying their respects to the beloved community dog who had brought so much joy over the years.\n\nAs the last light of the day faded, a strange sensation began to spread through Charlie's body. It started as a tingling in his paws, then moved up his legs, through his torso, and finally to his throat. For a moment, he felt a surge of energy, a spark that he hadn't felt in months. He opened his mouth, and to everyone's astonishment, a clear, human-like voice emerged.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Charlie said, his voice raspy but unmistakably his. The family looked at each other in disbelief, their eyes wide with wonder. \"Thank you for everything,\" he continued, his gaze meeting each of their faces. \"You've been my family, my pack, and I love you more than words can express.\"\n\nEmma's tears flowed freely now, mingling with the fur on Charlie's head. \"We love you too, Charlie,\" she managed to say, her voice choked with emotion. \"You've brought so much happiness into our lives.\"\n\nCharlie nodded, his tail wagging weakly. \"I know, and I hope I've made you proud.

Jack spent hours staking out Emma's favorite haunts, waiting for the perfect moment to snap a photo.\n\nBut as he was lurking in the shadows, Jack was suddenly grabbed from behind and dragged into a van. He struggled to free himself, but his captors were too strong. They took him to a secret location, where he was hypnotized and brainwashed into forgetting his true identity and purpose. When Jack came to, he found himself holding a gun instead of his camera. A voice in his head kept repeating: \"You are an assassin, not a photographer.\"\n\nConfused and disoriented, Jack stumbled out into the bright sunlight, gun in hand. His mind foggy from the hypnosis, he spotted Emma walking towards him on the sidewalk. The voice in his head whispered: \"Take aim...fire.\" But as he looked into Emma's eyes, something sparked within him. He hesitated, trying to remember who he really was and what he was doing with a gun. The trance began to break, and Jack realized with horror what he had been programmed to do. Would he be able to overcome his conditioning and spare Emma's life?",
        "Eli\u676d\u5dde\u5e02 had always thought he had the world by the tail. With the innate ability to read minds, life was an open book.\n\nSchool was a breeze; he knew the answers before the questions were asked.

He knew exactly what clients desired, making him a master salesman. \n\nBut every story has its twist, and Eli\u2019s came in the form of Lila. She moved into the apartment next door, a quiet, enigmatic figure who intrigued him beyond measure.\n\nAt first, he tried to brush it off, attributing his failure to nerves or distraction. Yet no matter how hard he focused, her thoughts remained a closed box.\n\nFrustration turned to obsession. Was she real, or just a manifestation of his isolation? \n\nOne rainy evening, Eli mustered the courage to knock on her door. \n\nLila greeted him with a warm smile, inviting him in as if they shared a secret understanding.\n\nAs they talked, Eli discovered something profound.

        "The day of first contact finally arrived, and with it, a mix of excitement and trepidation.\n\nAs the alien spacecraft landed on Earth's surface, a team of ambassadors was dispatched to greet the extraterrestrial visitors.\n\nTo everyone's surprise, the aliens emerged from their ship with warm smiles and open arms.\n\nThey introduced themselves as the \"Elders\" and expressed their eagerness to learn about humanity.\n\nThe initial interactions were filled with exchanges of basic information, such as language, culture, and customs.\n\nHowever, it soon became apparent that the Elders' society was deeply rooted in their religious beliefs.\n\nTheir faith was based on a complex pantheon of deities and scriptures that seemed fantastical to human ears.\n\nDespite the initial skepticism, humanity was receptive to learning more about the Elders' spiritual practices.\n\nAs discussions progressed, intriguing parallels began to emerge between human mythology and Elder scripture.\n\nSome of these similarities were strikingly precise, suggesting that there might be more to these stories than mere fiction.\n\nThe Elders revealed that their religion was not just a matter of blind faith but an integral part of their daily lives.\n\nThey practiced a unique form of meditation that allowed them to tap into a collective consciousness. \n\nThis phenomenon piqued human interest in understanding its mechanics. \n\nResearchers speculated that this collective consciousness might be linked to an as-yet-unknown form of energy or dimension. \n\nJoint studies were initiated to explore this concept further. \n\nPreliminary findings hinted at realities beyond what humanity had previously considered possible. \n\nFurther investigation could very well redefine our understanding of the universe.",
        "In the shadowed corners of a once formidable fortress, now a sprawling prison, the air was thick with whispers and the scent of rain-soaked concrete. The world outside had recently outlawed the death penalty, but within these walls, a new form of execution was quietly taking shape.\n\nThe prison, known as Greythorn, had long been a place of forgotten souls. But with the recent abolition, the population swelled, straining the already crumbling structure. Desperate for a solution, the warden, a stern man with eyes like cold steel, introduced a peculiar position: the Specialist.\n\nThis Specialist was neither judge nor jury, but a master of words, tasked with a grim duty. His job was to convince inmates to take their own lives, easing the burden of overcrowding. Few knew of his existence, and fewer still understood the true nature of his work.\n\nThe man chosen for this role was named Elias. He was a former psychologist, his past marred by failures and ethical breaches. Now, he roamed the cellblocks, his voice a soothing balm that concealed darker intentions.\n\nElias\u2019s first subject was a young man named Marcus, convicted of a crime he claimed he didn\u2019t commit. Marcus\u2019s eyes were full of fear and anger, but Elias spoke of peace, of a release from suffering. The words flowed effortlessly, a practiced dance of manipulation.\n\nDays turned into weeks as Elias moved from cell to cell, each conversation a battle of wills. Some inmates resisted, their spirits unbroken. Others, worn down by years of despair, found solace in his promises. \n\nOne such inmate was Lily, an artist whose canvases were now replaced by the stark walls of her cell. She had always sought beauty in the darkest places, and Elias\u2019s words painted a picture of a world beyond suffering. Slowly, she began to see his vision.\n\nThe warden watched from a distance, his satisfaction growing with each successful case. The prison\u2019s population dwindled, and the pressure eased.",
        "The city was a web of shadows and secrets, where the line between right and wrong often blurred into obscurity. Among its winding alleys and towering skyscrapers, a figure known only as \"The Raven\" operated with precision and silence. No mission was too complex, no target too elusive. Until now.\n\nTonight, The Raven stood on the edge of a rooftop overlooking the penthouse suite of their target, a notorious arms dealer named Viktor Rezkov. The job had been simple on paper: enter, eliminate, and exit. But as The Raven surveyed the scene, a sense of unease settled in. Something felt off.\n\nThe Raven's contact, a shadowy figure known as \"The Broker,\" had provided all the necessary intel: Rezkov's movements, his security, and his weaknesses. Everything should have been perfect. Yet, The Raven couldn't shake the feeling that this would be different.\n\nRezkov was a man surrounded by layers of protection. His penthouse was a fortress, with armed guards patrolling the perimeter and state-of-the-art security systems monitoring every inch. The Raven had anticipated these obstacles, but there was something else, something intangible, that made this mission feel like a trap.\n\nThe Raven adjusted the scope of their rifle, zeroing in on the target. Rezkov was inside, visible through the tinted windows. He was sitting at a desk, a phone pressed to his ear, his expression calm and composed. The moment seemed right. The Raven took a deep breath and began to exhale, preparing to pull the trigger.\n\nBut as the finger squeeze tightened, a sudden noise erupted below. Alarms blared, and the guards went into high alert. The Raven cursed under their breath. How could this have happened? They had checked and double-checked every detail. It was as if Rezkov's presence alone was a deterrent.\n\nThe Raven quickly assessed the situation. The plan had to change. They stashed the rifle and made their way down to the street level. The decision to go in close quarters was risky, but it was the only way to ensure the mission's success. The Raven's training kicked in, and they moved with the fluidity of a shadow through the city's underbelly.\n\nThe Raven found an entrance through a service door, one that had been overlooked by Rezkov's security. It was a narrow, dimly lit corridor, but it led directly to the heart of the penthouse. The Raven pulled out a set of lockpicks and worked quickly, the metal clicking and sliding into place with practiced ease.\n\nOnce inside, The Raven moved silently, navigating the maze of corridors and avoiding the guards. The plan was to reach Rezkov's office undetected and neutralize the threat. But every step felt like walking through quicksand, resistance building with each movement.\n\nThe Raven reached the outer office, where a secretary was diligently typing away. The Raven paused, observing the woman for any sign of suspicion. She seemed oblivious to the danger. The Raven made a quick decision and injected the secretary with a sedative, ensuring she would remain asleep until the mission was complete.\n\nThe door to Rezkov's office was the final barrier. The Raven took a deep breath, ready to confront the target. But as they opened the door, they were met with an unexpected sight. The office was empty.\n\nConfusion clouded The Raven's mind. Where was Rezkov? The Broker's intel had been clear. The target should have been here. The Raven searched the room, finding no trace of the arms dealer. It was as if he had vanished into thin air.\n\nThe Raven's instincts screamed that something was amiss. They retraced their steps, checking every possible hiding spot. But Rezkov was nowhere to be found. It was as if he had slipped through the cracks, leaving no trail behind.\n\nThe Raven returned to the rooftop, frustration growing with each passing moment. They rechecked the intel, the plans, and the security systems. Everything was in order. So why had Rezkov disappeared?\n\nThe Raven decided to take a different approach. They contacted The Broker, demanding an explanation. The Broker's response was cryptic, filled with veiled threats and half-truths. The Raven realized that the job was more complex than they had initially thought. There were forces at play, invisible threads connecting the dots in ways The Raven couldn't perceive.\n\nDetermined to complete the mission, The Raven began to dig deeper. They infiltrated Rezkov's network, hacking into his communications and tracking his movements.",
        "In the depths of the ancient forest, where the trees whispered secrets of the old world, there lived a woman named Elara. She was known for her unmatched beauty and her equally unmatched misfortune. Despite her allure, she was barren, a fact that haunted her deeply. Desperate for a child, she ventured into the forest one fateful night, seeking the aid of the legendary witch, Morag. The forest was alive with the sounds of nocturnal creatures and the scent of damp earth. Morag\u2019s cottage loomed ahead, its windows glowing with a faint, eerie light.\n\nElara knocked on the door, her heart pounding with a mix of hope and fear. The door creaked open, and Morag\u2019s gaunt face appeared, her eyes piercing through the darkness. \u201cI need your help,\u201d Elara pleaded, her voice trembling. \u201cI want a child.\u201d Morag studied her for a moment, her gaze cold and calculating. \u201cI can grant your wish, but in return, you must promise me your firstborn child.\u201d Elara hesitated, the weight of the promise heavy on her heart. But the desire for a child was overwhelming. \u201cI agree,\u201d she whispered, sealing the pact with a blood oath.\n\nMeanwhile, in a distant village, a man named Thorne faced his own despair. A skilled blacksmith, Thorne\u2019s life was defined by his forge, but his heart ached for something more\u2014a family. Like Elara, he sought the help of a witch, this time the notorious Lilith, who dwelled in a shadowy cave at the edge of the village. Thorne approached the cave, his steps heavy with determination. Lilith emerged from the darkness, her eyes glowing with an otherworldly light. \u201cI want a child,\u201d Thorne said, his voice steady. \u201cI will grant you your wish,\u201d Lilith replied, her voice smooth as silk. \u201cBut in return, you must promise me your firstborn child.\u201d Thorne, driven by his longing, agreed without hesitation, sealing the pact with a drop of his blood.\n\nYears passed, and Elara and Thorne\u2019s paths crossed at a village fair. Their eyes met, and an instant connection sparked between them. They began to court, and soon, their love blossomed into a deep, unbreakable bond. They married, and their union was celebrated with joy and festivities. Elara\u2019s barrenness seemed to have lifted, and she soon found herself pregnant. The villagers rejoiced, and Elara and Thorne were overjoyed at the prospect of starting a family.\n\nNine months later, a healthy baby girl was born. They named her Lila, and she brought immense happiness to their lives. But as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, a sense of unease settled over Elara and Thorne. They remembered the dark pacts they had made and the looming deadline. They knew they had to confess to each other, but the fear of the unknown held them back.\n\nOne stormy evening, as the wind howled and the rain lashed against the windows, Elara and Thorne sat by the fireplace, their faces illuminated by the flickering flames. \u201cThorne,\u201d Elara began, her voice trembling, \u201cthere\u2019s something I need to tell you.\u201d Thorne\u2019s heart skipped a beat. \u201cI have something to confess as well,\u201d he said, his voice equally tense. They exchanged their stories, the weight of their secrets finally lifted. The realization of their predicament hit them hard.",
        "\"Are you Dick?\" The barista called out, looking at the order slip in her hand. Richard sighed inwardly before flashing a polite smile. \"Actually, it's Richard,\" he replied with a hint of exasperation. It seemed like no matter how many times he corrected people, they still insisted on calling him by the nickname that irked him to no end.\n\nAs Richard waited for his latte, his mind wandered back to when this all started. He remembered his first day of school vividly, the teacher doing roll call and pausing when she reached his name. \"Dick?\" she had questioned, causing snickers from his classmates and a blush to spread across his cheeks as he hastily corrected her. From then on, it seemed the misnaming trend never really stopped.\n\nIn college, Richard thought things would be different\u2014a fresh start where nobody knew about his childhood nickname mishap.

        "The forest was eerily silent, the kind of stillness that grips you when the world holds its breath. Behind a gnarled oak, I pressed my body as close to the trunk as possible, my breaths shallow, my eyes locked onto the clearing. Just minutes earlier, the sound of a crash had shattered the quiet, a metallic groan followed by the screaming of twisted metal and the hiss of escaping steam. Now, amidst the wreckage of what looked like a small plane, chaos reigned.\n\nTwo figures in military fatigues emerged from the underbrush, their movements deliberate and deadly. They were methodical, like assassins with a mission. Each step they took was precise, their eyes scanning the scene for signs of life. My heart pounded in my chest, but I dared not move. I was just a traveler, a hiker lost on this trail, and now I was witnessing something that I could never unsee.\n\nThe first survivor was a young woman, no more than twenty, her face bloodied but conscious. She lay on the ground, her hand gripping a torn piece of fabric. One of the men, taller and with a more prominent scar running down his cheek, approached her. She begged for mercy, her voice breaking with every plea. He didn\u2019t even flinch. A single shot echoed through the clearing, and her body went limp.\n\nI swallowed hard, bile rising in my throat. This wasn\u2019t a rescue mission; it was a massacre. The men moved on to the next survivor, a middle-aged man who was trying to tend to a wounded child. The scarred man shot the child first, a cruel act that seemed designed to break the father\u2019s spirit. The father\u2019s screams were short-lived; the second man, shorter and with a cold, unflinching gaze, put a bullet through his head.\n\nThe horror was overwhelming. I couldn\u2019t tear my eyes away, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to act either. The men had weapons, and I had nothing but a small knife and a shaky resolve. As they continued their grim work, I realized that I was the only witness, and if I wanted to survive, I needed to stay hidden.\n\nThe next survivor was an older woman, perhaps in her sixties. She had crawled away from the plane, her leg twisted at an unnatural angle. The scarred man stepped towards her, his gun raised. But something stopped him. He paused, his eyes narrowing. He looked around the clearing, and for a moment, I thought he might have seen me. I held my breath, my muscles tensing, ready to bolt.\n\nHe cursed under his breath and turned his attention back to the woman. But she was no longer alone. From the wreckage, a man had emerged, his clothes tattered and his body covered in dirt. He lunged at the scarred man, a desperate act of courage. They wrestled, the man\u2019s strength surprising, but the soldier was trained. He managed to break free and aimed his gun.\n\nThe shorter man raised his weapon to help, but before he could shoot, a voice rang out. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d\n\nWe all froze. Another man, older and with a commanding presence, stepped into the clearing. His uniform was different, more ornate. He looked at the scene with a mix of disgust and resignation. \u201cThis is not how we operate,\u201d he said, his voice firm.\n\nThe two men hesitated, their eyes darting between their superior and the struggling figures. The older man approached the scarred soldier and grabbed the gun, jerking it away. \u201cYou and he are dismissed from this unit,\u201d he said, his voice cold. \u201cYou\u2019ve disgraced us.\u201d\n\nThe scarred man\u2019s face contorted with rage, but he knew better than to argue. He and the other soldier turned and disappeared into the forest, their exit swift and silent.\n\nThe older man turned to the survivors. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for what you\u2019ve seen,\u201d he said, his voice softer now.",
        "As I stood on the dusty terrain, I felt the familiar tingle in my toes, a sensation that had guided me to countless discoveries throughout my career. The archaeologists around me were abuzz with excitement, eager to uncover the secrets that lay beneath our feet. But as I focused on the subtle vibrations, I sensed something different. A feeling of unease crept up my spine, and for the first time in years, I hesitated.\n\n\"We should not dig here,\" I said finally, my voice firm but laced with a sense of trepidation. The team turned to me in surprise, their faces etched with confusion and skepticism. \"What do you mean?\" one of them asked, but I just shook my head. I couldn't explain it, not yet.

        "In the bustling city of Arcadia, where towering spires of magic crystals illuminated the streets, a unique phenomenon shaped its inhabitants' lives. In this world, fat was not just a physical accumulation but a precious reservoir of Mana or Magical Power. Those who possessed more significant deposits of fat were revered for their potent magical abilities and respected for their boundless potential. People revered those with overflowing mana as they could perform incredible feats with ease compared to those whose mana reserves were lower.\n\nOne such individual was Luna, a young woman with an extraordinary gift for manipulating elemental forces using her abundant fat stores. Her remarkable control over fire and water made her not only feared but also highly sought after by powerful factions within the city. However, Luna's path was fraught with challenges as she struggled to balance her insatiable hunger for knowledge and power with the responsibility that came with wielding such immense magical might stored in her body full of excess mana.\n\nAs tensions rose between rival groups vying for supremacy in Arcadia, Luna found herself at the center of a brewing conflict that threatened to consume everything she held dear. With each spell she cast draining her reserve of fat-based Mana, Luna faced an impossible choice - embrace her destiny as a beacon of strength and hope or succumb to the dark allure of unchecked power that beckoned from within her very being. As battles raged and alliances crumbled around her, Luna realized that true strength lay not in the abundance of one's magical reserves but in one's ability to harness them wisely and protect those who mattered most against all odds.\n\nIn the end, it wasn't just about accumulating more fat or mastering powerful spells; it was about finding balance within oneself amidst chaos and uncertainty.",
        "The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cavern walls, illuminating grotesque symbols etched into the cold stone.  A chanting echoed around me, a low, guttural drone that resonated deep within my bones. My head throbbed, a dull ache that pulsed with the rhythm of the chant.\n\nI had been standing in my kitchen, a cup of lukewarm coffee in hand, when the world dissolved into a swirling vortex of colors.  Now, I stood disoriented, clad in my pajamas, amidst a circle of robed figures. Their faces were obscured by dark hoods, but I could feel the weight of their gazes, heavy with anticipation.\n\nThe air crackled with an unnatural energy, a palpable tension that made the hairs on my arms stand on end.  A pungent aroma of incense and something else, something metallic and acrid, filled the air.  The chanting intensified, rising to a feverish crescendo.\n\nA figure emerged from the shadows, its robes more ornate than the others.  It raised a gnarled hand, and the chanting abruptly ceased.  A silence descended, heavy and oppressive.  The figure gestured towards me, a slow, deliberate movement.\n\n\"You,\" a raspy voice croaked, \"have been chosen.\"\n\nChosen? For what? I tried to speak, to demand answers, but my voice caught in my throat.  Fear, cold and paralyzing, gripped me.\n\nThe robed figures closed in, their movements eerily synchronized.  I stumbled backward, desperate to escape their encircling presence.  The cavern walls seemed to press in on me, suffocating me.\n\nThey dragged me towards a stone altar, its surface slick with some dark, viscous substance.  I struggled against their grip, but their hold was too strong.  Panic clawed at me, threatening to overwhelm my senses.\n\nThe robed leader approached the altar, holding a gleaming dagger aloft.

        "The world shuddered, a tremor so subtle it registered only as a collective, unconscious unease. The shift, however, was profound.  Agnes, a baker kneading dough in the pre-dawn chill, felt a prickle at the back of her neck, a fleeting thought that wasn't hers \u2013 the memory of a child's laughter, a swing set under a sprawling oak.  It vanished as quickly as it came, leaving her bewildered.  She wasn't alone. Across the globe, minds flickered with alien echoes, the first whispers of a new, terrible reality.\n\nThe change manifested fully with the first intentional killing.  A jealous rage in a dimly lit apartment, a knife plunged into a heart.  The killer, momentarily stunned, recoiled not in horror, but in a dizzying influx of memories, of sensations, of knowledge.  The victim's cherished childhood moments, his intimate fears, his honed expertise as a violinist \u2013 all became the murderer's, woven inextricably into his own consciousness.  A terrifying precedent had been set.  The world had become a grotesque buffet of minds, each life a potential feast for a predator.\n\nInitially, law enforcement was baffled.  Cases that seemed open-and-shut dissolved into confusion as witnesses recounted contradictory details, as physical evidence pointed in multiple directions.  The killers, imbued with their victims' innermost secrets, moved with uncanny foresight, anticipating every investigative step, weaving intricate webs of deception.  They became chameleons, shedding their own identities and adopting fragments of those they consumed, a disturbing collage of stolen lives.\n\nAmong the worst were the serial killers.  No longer driven solely by primal urges, they evolved into something far more sinister: collectors.  Each life taken was a new acquisition, a skill set absorbed, a personality integrated.  They became walking libraries of stolen experiences, encyclopedias of human lives, their own identities fragmented beyond recognition, a grotesque mosaic of their victims.  They hunted not for the thrill of the kill, but for the intoxicating power of assimilation, the allure of becoming more than human.\n\nOne such predator, known only as \"The Weaver,\" terrorized a sprawling metropolis.  He began with petty criminals, absorbing their street smarts, their knowledge of the city's underbelly.  He moved on to artists, acquiring their creative flair, their understanding of color and composition.  Then came the scientists, the linguists, the strategists, each victim adding another layer to his terrifying repertoire.  The Weaver became a phantom, a ghost in the machine, a creature of a thousand faces.\n\nDetective Miles Corbin, a veteran haunted by his own failures, became obsessed with the Weaver.  He saw in the escalating complexity of the crimes a chilling pattern, a perverse form of evolution.  Corbin understood that he wasn't hunting a single individual, but a legion inhabiting a single body, a monstrous amalgamation of stolen lives.  The Weaver, in his insatiable hunger, had become a reflection of the city itself, a living embodiment of its collective consciousness.\n\nCorbin's pursuit led him down a rabbit hole of fragmented memories, of contradictory clues.  He learned to decipher the whispers of the absorbed minds, to separate the Weaver's original persona from the cacophony of stolen identities.  He saw the subtle shifts in behavior, the fleeting expressions, the echoes of personalities struggling to surface within the monster.  He began to understand the Weaver not as a single entity, but as a battlefield of warring consciousnesses.",

I had to get out of there, had to try and change the course of events that would unfold. But as I rushed to get dressed, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was trapped in some kind of never-ending nightmare. Every decision, every action, seemed predetermined, like I was following a script that had already been written.\n\nI took a deep breath and tried to focus on the task at hand. If I could just alter one small thing, maybe everything would turn out differently. But as I made my way downstairs to face whatever horrors awaited me, I couldn't help but wonder - what's the point? Was this some kind of cosmic punishment, forcing me to relive my darkest moment over and over? Or was it a chance for redemption, an opportunity to make things right?",

        "\"They call us monsters, son,\" his father whispered as they sat huddled in the dimly lit cave. The boy stared wide-eyed, his mind racing with questions. \"But why, Papa? Are we really monsters?\" he asked, his voice filled with fear and confusion. His father's weathered face softened, and he reached out to ruffle his son's hair. \"No, my boy. We are not monsters. They just don't understand us,\" he reassured, his voice tinged with a hint of sadness.\n\nThe boy's thoughts drifted to the times they had been chased out of villages, the fearful glances they received from strangers, and the hurtful words that had been thrown at them like stones. They were different, that much was clear. Their skin was rough and scaly, their eyes gleamed like emeralds in the dark, and their voices carried a deep resonance that sent shivers down the spines of those who heard them. But beneath their exterior, they were just like any other father and son, seeking solace and acceptance in a world that feared the unknown.\n\nAs the fire crackled softly in front of them, casting eerie shadows on the cave walls, the boy felt a surge of defiance rising within him. \"I don't care what they call us, Papa. I know who we are,\" he declared, his young voice filled with determination. His father gazed at him with pride, a glint of hope flickering in his eyes. \"That's my boy. Remember, it's not what they call you that matters, but how you choose to define yourself,\" he imparted, his words carrying the weight of years of experience and resilience.\n\nWith a newfound sense of purpose burning in his heart, the boy vowed to stand tall in the face of adversity, to show the world that they were not monsters to be feared but beings deserving of respect and understanding. Together, father and son emerged from the shadows of the cave, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. And as they walked into the moonlit night, the boy whispered to his father, \"They call us monsters, but I know we are so much more.\" And in that moment, surrounded by the beauty of the night sky, they felt a glimmer of acceptance and belonging, knowing that their bond transcended the narrow judgments of others.",
        "In a world where diseases couldn't be cured but could only be passed on, a unique bond between the old and the young was forged. When someone neared the end of their days due to age, they had the option to act as recipients for all the ailments plaguing the younger generation. It became a sacred ritual, revered by both old and young alike. The elderly would selflessly take on illnesses, allowing their final act to be one of benevolence towards those yet to fully experience life.\n\nOne such recipient was Elder Mara, who had lived a long and fulfilling life. She was known throughout the community for her wisdom and kindness. As she approached her final years, it was time for her to make her choice - to pass peacefully or take on the burden of diseases for others. Without hesitation, Mara volunteered to become a recipient in order to ensure that those just starting out in life would have every chance at happiness and health.\n\nThe day arrived when Mara underwent the ceremony that would transfer all manner of sicknesses from the youth onto herself. It was a solemn occasion marked by deep gratitude and respect from all who witnessed it. The young ones watched with awe as Elder Mara's frail body absorbed their ailments one by one until she bore them all within herself.\n\nAs time passed, Mara's health deteriorated rapidly under this heavy burden, yet she never once regretted her decision. She found solace in knowing that she had played a crucial role in preserving the well-being of future generations. The young people whose lives she had touched continued forward unencumbered by illness or suffering thanks to her sacrifice.\n\nWhen Mara finally drew her last breath, there was not an ounce of disease left within anyone else - only gratitude and love for this remarkable woman who had given so much without expecting anything in return. And as new lives blossomed free from afflictions once thought inevitable, Elder Mara's spirit lived on in every healthy heartbeat across the land.",
        "As I lie here, my life slipping away with each faint beat of my heart, I'm met with a morbid sense of irony. I had given up on life already, the weight of my struggles having become too much to bear. But it wasn't my own hand that was supposed to bring about my demise, not like this anyway. I had envisioned a solitary end, one of quiet desperation, not a brutal and violent thrust of a stranger's knife. And yet, here I am, the slow seep of blood from my wound a cruel reminder that sometimes fate has other plans. My mind is at peace now, finally free from the tormented thoughts that plagued me for so long. It's almost laughable, really - all that angst, all that fear, and in the end, it's not my own despair that kills me, but the reckless abandon of a stranger's brutality.",
        "The sprawling ant colony pulsed with a silent hum, a symphony of shared thoughts, a chorus of tiny minds intertwined.  Each ant, a single note in this vast, intricate orchestra, contributed to the colony\u2019s collective consciousness, a shared intelligence that grew with every new member.  For generations, the colony had thrived, expanding its reach beneath the forest floor, its network of tunnels a labyrinth of interconnectedness.  Now, on the cusp of an unprecedented breakthrough, the colony stood poised to transcend the boundaries of insect intellect.\n\nDeep within the colony's heart, the queen, a pulsating vessel of life, lay amidst her brood.  Her thoughts, amplified by her royal status, resonated throughout the colony, a constant beacon guiding her countless offspring.  Around her, worker ants scurried, their tiny antennae twitching, receiving and transmitting a constant stream of information, a silent dialogue that orchestrated the colony\u2019s every move.\n\nThe colony's collective intelligence, a gestalt entity born from the interconnectedness of its members, had reached a critical mass.  The sheer number of ants, each a tiny processing unit in this biological supercomputer, had pushed their shared consciousness to the brink of a major evolutionary leap.  The air within the colony crackled with anticipation, a palpable sense of impending transformation.\n\nThe colony's oldest ants, their exoskeletons worn and weathered, carried the memories of generations past, a living library of experiences and knowledge.  These veteran ants, their minds rich with the wisdom of ages, served as the colony's memory keepers, ensuring that the collective knowledge accumulated over time was not lost to the relentless cycle of birth and death.\n\nAs the colony continued to expand, its collective intelligence grew exponentially.  The ants began to exhibit signs of complex problem-solving abilities, devising intricate strategies for foraging and defense.  Their communication, once limited to simple chemical signals, now encompassed a richer, more nuanced language of shared thoughts and sensations.\n\nThe colony's scouts, venturing out into the unknown, relayed their findings back to the collective, expanding the colony's awareness of the world beyond their subterranean domain.  Every new discovery, every encounter with a predator or prey, added another piece to the puzzle, enriching the colony's understanding of its environment.\n\nThe queen, sensing the impending change, laid a special brood of eggs, larger and more translucent than the rest.  These eggs, imbued with the colony's collective wisdom and potential, held the key to the next stage of their evolution.  The worker ants tended to these special eggs with utmost care, their antennae constantly probing, their minds focused on nurturing the nascent life within.",

        "The fluorescent lights of the cafeteria hummed, casting a sterile glow over the usual lunchtime chaos.  Pizza grease hung heavy in the air, mingling with the scent of stale milk and teenage angst. I sat across from Sarah, my best friend since kindergarten, dissecting the complexities of Mrs. Davison's latest pop quiz.  We were mid-sentence, debating the merits of multiple-choice versus essay questions, when a sudden, sharp crack echoed through the room.\n\nIt wasn't the familiar bang of a locker slamming shut or the clatter of trays hitting the tiled floor. This sound was different \u2013 sharper, more sinister.  A collective gasp rippled through the cafeteria, followed by an eerie silence. Then, another crack, closer this time, accompanied by a scream that was abruptly cut short.\n\nConfusion morphed into terror as students scrambled to their feet, tables and chairs overturning in the ensuing panic. Sarah grabbed my hand, her knuckles white against mine.  \"Come on!\" she yelled, pulling me towards the nearest exit.\n\nWe stumbled through the surging crowd, the air thick with fear and adrenaline.  As we neared the doorway, a figure emerged from the swirling mass of students. It was Mark, a quiet kid from our math class, his face contorted in a mask of terror.  His shirt was stained crimson, a stark contrast to the pale linoleum floor.\n\nBefore I could process what I was seeing, a hand clamped down on my shoulder. I turned to see Sarah, her eyes wide and unfocused, a strange glint in their depths.  She thrust something cold and metallic into my hand \u2013 a gun.  My stomach lurched.  The weight of the weapon felt alien and unsettling in my palm.\n\n\"What...?\" I stammered, my voice barely a whisper.  The world seemed to tilt on its axis. Sarah, my best friend, the girl who shared my secrets and my dreams, was holding a gun. And she had just given me one.\n\n\"Take it,\" she hissed, her voice strained and unfamiliar.  \"You need to protect yourself.\"\n\nMy mind raced. Protect myself from what? From whom?  The question died on my lips as another shot rang out, this one closer than the last.",
        "The clock ticked past 3:00 AM, its rhythmic pulse a metronome marking the slow, steady descent into another sleepless night.  Fifty years had passed since Arthur Finchley first drew breath, fifty years of quiet routine and unremarkable existence.  He was a mid-level accountant, a creature of habit, his life a carefully orchestrated symphony of spreadsheets and tax returns. He was, in his own estimation, thoroughly, irrevocably ordinary.  But tonight, the ordinary was about to become extraordinary.\n\nA tingling sensation, like a thousand tiny spiders crawling beneath his skin, jolted Arthur awake.  It wasn't unpleasant, but unsettling, alien. He sat up in bed, the darkness of his room pressing in, the silence amplifying the strange hum that now seemed to emanate from within him. He switched on the bedside lamp, its warm glow offering little comfort against the growing unease that coiled in his stomach.\n\nHe rose and walked to the window, the cold glass a soothing balm against his feverish skin.  The city lights twinkled below, a million tiny sparks in the vast, indifferent darkness.  He felt suddenly detached, like a spectator watching a play, his life, his very existence, unfolding on a stage far below.\n\nAs he stood there, lost in the disorienting novelty of his sensations, a sudden urge, an inexplicable impulse, seized him.  He stretched out his hand towards the moon, a childish, almost whimsical gesture.  And then, it happened.\n\nA beam of pure white light, originating from his outstretched hand, shot across the sky, painting the night canvas with an ethereal luminescence.  The beam held steady, a tangible connection between him and the celestial body hovering above.  Arthur stared, dumbfounded, at his hand, then back at the moon, his mind struggling to reconcile the impossible with the undeniable reality before him.\n\nFear warred with fascination, a tumultuous battle raging within him.  He closed his hand, severing the connection, the beam vanishing as quickly as it had appeared.  The world plunged back into mundane darkness, but Arthur knew, with an unshakeable certainty, that nothing would ever be the same again.\n\nThe following days were a whirlwind of confusion and self-discovery.  Arthur, the man of numbers and routine, found himself navigating a world suddenly infused with extraordinary possibilities.  The tingling sensation persisted, a constant reminder of the power that now resided within him.  He experimented cautiously, tentatively, pushing the boundaries of his newfound abilities.\n\nHe discovered he could manipulate light, bending it to his will, creating illusions, even generating intense heat.  He could move objects with his mind, lifting furniture, manipulating small items with uncanny precision.  The world, once a predictable, orderly place, was now a playground of potential, a canvas awaiting his touch.\n\nBut with power came responsibility, a realization that settled upon Arthur with the weight of a thousand ledgers.  He was no longer just Arthur Finchley, the accountant. He was something more, something different.  And with that difference came a sense of obligation, a calling to use his powers for something beyond his own comprehension.\n\nHis first foray into superheroism was, to put it mildly, clumsy.  A cat stranded in a tree became the unwitting beneficiary of his nascent abilities.  He levitated the feline back to solid ground, earning him the bewildered stares of a small group of onlookers.  It wasn't exactly stopping a runaway train or thwarting a bank robbery, but it was a start.\n\nHe honed his skills in secret, practicing in the dead of night, transforming his mundane suburban backyard into a training ground for the extraordinary.  He learned to control his powers, to refine his abilities, to channel the raw energy that coursed through him.\n\nHis initial attempts at crime-fighting were fraught with awkwardness.  He stumbled through situations, often making matters worse before eventually managing to resolve them.  His costume, a hastily assembled ensemble of dark clothing and a ski mask, was less than intimidating, earning him more ridicule than respect.\n\nBut Arthur persevered.  He learned from his mistakes, adapting his approach, refining his techniques. He studied the movements of superheroes on television, gleaning insights, incorporating their strategies into his own repertoire.  He was, after all, still an accountant at heart, meticulous and analytical, approaching his new vocation with the same methodical precision he applied to balancing budgets.\n\nNews of his exploits, initially dismissed as urban legends or exaggerated tales, began to circulate.  He became known as \"The Night Watchman,\" a moniker bestowed upon him by the local newspaper, a testament to his nocturnal activities and unwavering dedication.",
        "In the depths of an ancient mountain, I stumbled upon a chamber that defied mortal comprehension. Golden light spilled from crystalline formations above, illuminating rows upon rows of pedestals bearing the most legendary weapons ever wielded by human hands.\n\nThere stood Mjolnir, crackling with barely contained lightning, its surface etched with runes that seemed to shift and dance. Beside it, Excalibur's pristine blade caught the light, casting rainbow refractions across the stone walls as if still wet from its emergence from the lake.\n\nGungnir, Odin's spear, floated impossibly in mid-air, while the Sword of Mars pulsed with an angry red glow. Each weapon bore the weight of history, of epic tales and fallen empires, of heroes and gods who had proven worthy to grasp their power.\n\nI had read of this place in forbidden texts \u2013 the Hall of Worthy Inheritance, where once each generation, those deemed deserving would come to claim their destined weapon. Some returned as legends, while others were never seen again.\n\nAs I walked between the pedestals, each weapon seemed to whisper, testing my worth and finding me wanting. Their voices were a chorus of rejection, until something else caught my attention \u2013 a different kind of call.\n\nIn the furthest corner, nearly hidden behind a pillar, sat a simple wooden staff. Decades of dust had settled upon it, and cobwebs draped it like a funeral shroud. Unlike the other weapons, it seemed forgotten, abandoned.\n\nBut its voice... its voice sang to me of autumn leaves and spring rain, of the quiet power of growing things and the patience of mountains. It spoke not of glory or conquest, but of protection and nurturing.\n\nMy hands trembled as I approached. The other weapons' whispers grew to shouts of warning or derision, but I could hear only the staff's gentle song.\n\nAs my fingers brushed its surface, the dust fell away to reveal wood that shifted like liquid moonlight. Power thrummed through my body, not the searing heat of battle-lust, but the deep, cool strength of roots delving into earth.\n\nI had found my weapon. Or perhaps, more accurately, it had found me.\n\nIn that moment, I understood that true power lies not always in the brightest glory or the sharpest blade, but sometimes in the quietest corners, waiting for the right soul to recognize its worth.",
        "The rasping voice, distorted and metallic, echoed in the stark white room.  Disoriented, I blinked against the harsh fluorescent light, my head throbbing.  \"You have 24 hours. No more, no less.\"  The voice cut off abruptly, leaving a ringing silence.  I sat up, the thin hospital gown clinging uncomfortably to my skin.  The room was bare, save for a small metal table and the single, unforgiving light fixture.  Panic clawed at my throat. Where was I?  Why was I here?\n\nMy memory was a fog, thick and impenetrable.  I tried to recall the events leading up to this moment, but my mind remained frustratingly blank.  Fragments of images flickered \u2013 a crowded street, a blinding flash of light, a piercing scream.  But they were fleeting, like wisps of smoke, impossible to grasp. The metallic tang of fear filled my mouth.\n\nI pushed myself off the narrow bed, my legs shaky.  The cold tile floor sent shivers up my spine.  I needed answers.  I needed to escape.  I scanned the room again, searching for any clue, any indication of what was happening.  My eyes fell on the metal table.  On it lay a single object: a sleek, black wristwatch, its face displaying a stark countdown timer.  23:58:02.\n\nThe numbers ticked down relentlessly, each second a hammer blow against my sanity.  24 hours. What happened after the clock reached zero?  What was I supposed to do? The questions swirled in my mind, a chaotic storm of confusion and dread.\n\nI strapped the watch onto my wrist, the cold metal a stark reminder of my predicament.  I had to get out of this room.  I rattled the door handle, but it was locked.  I pounded on the door, shouting for help, but only silence answered.  Desperation gnawed at me.  I was trapped.\n\nTurning back to the room, I began to search more thoroughly.  I ran my hands along the smooth walls, searching for a hidden switch, a loose panel, anything.  My fingers brushed against something slightly raised.  A small, almost imperceptible button.  I pressed it.\n\nA section of the wall slid open, revealing a narrow passage.  Hope surged through me, a powerful current against the tide of fear.  This was my chance.  Without hesitation, I slipped through the opening, the wall sliding shut behind me.",
        "In the heart of the bustling city, Carter knew the routine well. Each morning, he approached the unassuming ATM hidden in the shaded alcove of a forgotten alleyway. Punching in the familiar code, he awaited the calculated permission of survival funds for the day.\n\nDing! The screen flickered an unusual glow, and Carter\u2019s eyes widened. $70,000,000. Today was no ordinary day. The number blinked back at him, challenging his every notion of what \u201cneed\u201d truly meant.\n\nHe hesitated, glancing over his shoulder as if someone else might be intruding on this intimate moment with fate. The crumpled bills began to spill into the tray, an endless cascade of opportunity and responsibility.\n\nCarter stuffed the thick bundles into a backpack, heart pounding with both excitement and trepidation. What did it mean, to survive with seventy million? The question loomed large, unanswered.\n\nFor a moment, Carter contemplated the extraordinary implications. He could disappear, create a new identity, or indulge in the wildest excesses. But something tethered him; a small voice, reminding him of intention and purpose.\n\nEmerging from the alley, Carter blended into the sea of commuters, his backpack weighing more like a destiny than a burden. He decided on a caf\u00e9 for coffee, something he did every morning, blending routine with reality.\n\nSipping his cappuccino, he glanced out at the street. A line of frazzled office workers scurried past, tethered to lives tethered by smaller numbers. A thought occurred to him: liberation needn\u2019t mean isolation.\n\nHe had heard of a homeless shelter on Ninth Avenue struggling despite their best efforts. It was the kind of place that could do a world of good with just a fraction of what he had.\n\nA quick taxi ride later, Carter walked into the shelter, greeted by the tired yet welcoming smiles of volunteers. He asked for the director, a pragmatic woman named Edith.\n\nEdith listened, eyes widening as Carter explained his intent. \u201cNo strings attached,\u201d he assured her, \u201cjust the chance to make life a bit better.\u201d\n\nShe hesitated, caught between disbelief and hope. She welcomed the promised check with grateful tears, the potential to expand their resources, extend their reach, offering dignity and warmth to those on the fringes.\n\nLeaving the shelter, Carter felt lighter. There was something thrilling in using unexpected fortune to tip the scales a bit. But there was more to the day, more to be imagined, more to be enacted.\n\nHe wandered downtown, past shiny storefronts selling shiny things. The muted call of materialism felt distant today. What could he find truly worth investing in?\n\nAt a school underfunded and overburdened, his inquiry of need returned a list longer than he imagined. Libraries outdated, classrooms sun-starved, creativity stifled by budget constraints.",
        "In the quiet valleys of a land once plagued by scarcity, the great discovery occurred. A power once unimaginable, known as Lumina, emerged from deep beneath the ancient mountain ranges. The ground shook, not with menace, but with a gentle reminder of a world now pivoting towards promise. This energy, gleaming and constant, seemed to defy the very laws of nature, creating a ripple of breathless anticipation across the globe. The Lumina was inexhaustible, and with it came the whisper of dreams no longer tethered by limitation or need.\n\nThe citizens of this world reacted with incredulous awe, and soon, the utopian implications began to unfold. Harnessed by scientists whose imaginations once dared only peek at such possibilities, Lumina lit up the cities, transforming the night into day and the ordinary into extraordinary. Homes that were once dim and cold filled with warmth and color, as if life itself had been infused with newfound vibrancy. It was as though the very fabric of society were being rewritten in radiant light.\n\nIndustry transformed overnight. The smog and soot-filled skylines gave way to clean air, void of the black plumes of carbon smoke. Lumina-powered machinery operated ceaselessly without the environmental toll of their predecessors, and vehicles soared across a skyline as free as birds taking flight. The sound of innovation became the music of daily life, energizing the minds and hearts of a people who now had the wind of endless energy beneath their sails.\n\nYet in this age of abundance, undeniable challenges emerged. Resources, once fought over with ferocity, became obsolete as Lumina drove machinery and manufacturing to self-sufficiency. Entire sectors of economy once dependent on oil and coal unraveled, their structures crumbling under the weight of redundancy. There was no longer a race for resources, but a race to redefine worth and purpose in this new society.\n\nIn education, children grew up with textbooks and lessons emphasizing not scarcity, but stewardship.",
        "The cool, smooth weight was absent. My wrist felt strangely light, exposed. For the first time in my memory, the skin beneath where the bracelet had resided felt the air. I stared at my bare wrist, a phantom sensation of the bracelet's presence lingering.\n\nI flexed my hand, a nervous habit I'd developed over the years, my fingers brushing against the empty space. It was gone. The solid, unyielding band that had been a part of me for as long as I could remember had simply vanished.\n\nI traced the faint indentation on my skin, a ghostly outline of the bracelet's form. It was a perfect circle, unbroken, a constant reminder of its presence. Now, only the echo remained.\n\nThe bracelet had been a mystery, a permanent fixture in my life. I couldn't recall a time before it adorned my wrist. It was as much a part of me as my own hand.\n\nCountless attempts to remove it had ended in frustration. It resisted every effort, impervious to any tool or technique. It remained steadfast, unyielding, a constant companion.\n\nI had grown accustomed to its presence, its unwavering weight a familiar comfort. It had become an extension of myself, an intrinsic part of my identity.\n\nNow, the emptiness on my wrist felt unsettling, a void where something integral had been. The absence was palpable, a constant reminder of what was missing.\n\nI examined the spot where it had fallen, searching for any clue, any explanation. But there was nothing. The bracelet had vanished without a trace.\n\nPanic began to set in, a cold dread creeping up my spine. The bracelet had been more than just an accessory; it had been a part of me.\n\nI felt exposed, vulnerable, as if a shield had been removed. The world seemed sharper, more threatening, without the bracelet's silent protection.\n\nI retraced my steps, desperately searching for the missing piece of myself. I checked every corner, every crevice, but it was nowhere to be found.\n\nThe loss was profound, a sense of incompleteness gnawing at me. I felt adrift, untethered, without the familiar weight on my wrist.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and still, the bracelet remained elusive. The emptiness on my wrist became a constant reminder of its absence, a symbol of a part of me that was gone.\n\nI began to question my memories, my identity. Who was I without the bracelet? Was it more than just an ornament? Had it been holding something back, something I was now free to discover?\n\nThe questions lingered, unanswered, echoing the emptiness on my wrist. The mystery of the bracelet remained, a silent enigma in the unfolding narrative of my life.\n\nThe world felt different now, altered in ways I couldn't quite comprehend. The absence of the bracelet had left a void, a space waiting to be filled. But with what?",
        "Ezra had just graduated from Hell Academy with top honors in Torture Methods. As he eagerly awaited his assignment, visions of prestigious wards like Identity Theft and Gaslighting danced in his head. But to Ezra's surprise, he was assigned to the little-known \"Miscellaneous\" ward. Confused and slightly disappointed, he accepted his fate with a mix of curiosity and determination.\n\nThe Miscellaneous ward was located on the outskirts of Hell, far from the bustling corridors of the main wards. It was a strange amalgamation of souls who didn't quite fit into any specific category of torment. Ezra's first day on the job felt like stepping into a chaotic realm where rules were blurred and boundaries non-existent.\n\nDespite his initial skepticism, Ezra threw himself into his new role with fervor. He realized that being in charge of such an unconventional ward allowed him to explore uncharted territories in the art of torture. The souls under his care were a peculiar mix \u2013 from failed musicians haunted by their soundless instruments to dreamers shattered by broken promises.\n\nDay after day, Ezra delved deep into their darkest fears and desires, seeking ways to evoke torment like no other. He experimented with unconventional methods - weaving nightmares out of forgotten memories and crafting illusions so vivid they bled into reality. Each soul presented a unique challenge for him to unravel and exploit.\n\nOne soul in particular caught Ezra's attention \u2013 a former poet consumed by self-doubt and writer's block for eternity. Determined to break this spirit once and for all, Ezra orchestrated elaborate scenarios designed to crush any remaining flicker of creativity within him. But as days turned into weeks, he found himself strangely drawn to the poet's inner turmoil.\n\nIn moments when no eyes watched over them, they engaged in conversations that transcended captor-prisoner dynamics. The poet spoke of lost dreams and unfulfilled aspirations while Ezra shared tales from his own past \u2013 stories buried beneath layers of darkness even he dared not revisit.\n\nAs their bond deepened amid shadows cast by eternal flames, Ezra began questioning the very essence of torment itself. Was it truly about inflicting pain or rather about confronting one's deepest insecurities?",
        "In the vast expanse of the Andromeda Alliance, species pride themselves on their unique evolutionary advantages. The Xylons boast unmatched computational abilities, while the Merians possess extraordinary regenerative powers.\n\nYet, none can match humanity's lightning-fast reflexes.

        "In the dimly lit corner of a downtown coffee shop, Sarah stirred her latte absently, trying to make small talk with her blind date. He seemed normal enough - well-dressed, polite, and moderately handsome - but something about him felt different from the usual finance bros and tech startup founders she typically encountered.\n\n\"So what do you do?\" she asked, taking another sip of her overpriced coffee, expecting the usual mundane response. Instead, his eyes sparkled with an intensity that made her pause mid-sip.\n\n\"I'm a ninja-dragon slayer,\" he replied matter-of-factly, as if he'd just told her he was an accountant. The coffee caught in Sarah's throat, and she coughed, drawing curious glances from nearby tables.\n\n\"Um, what?\" she managed to sputter, wondering if this was some elaborate joke or if she should be reaching for her phone to call for help. He maintained his composed demeanor, carefully adjusting the silver pendant around his neck - was that a dragon's claw?\n\n\"Have you ever seen a ninja-dragon?\" he asked, leaning forward slightly, his voice dropping to just above a whisper. Sarah found herself unconsciously mirroring his movement, drawn into the conversation despite her better judgment.\n\n\"Well, no,\" she admitted, realizing how ridiculous the question was even as she answered it. A small smile played at the corners of his mouth as he sat back in his chair, spreading his hands in a gesture of accomplishment.\n\n\"You're welcome,\" he said simply, taking a sip of his black coffee. Sarah opened her mouth to argue, then closed it again, her mind racing through the implications of what he'd just said.\n\nThe silence stretched between them, broken only by the whir of the espresso machine and the murmur of conversation around them. Sarah studied his face, noting for the first time the thin scar that ran along his jawline and the calluses on his hands - not the soft hands of an office worker, but the weathered hands of someone who had seen action.\n\nAs the afternoon light filtered through the coffee shop windows, casting strange shadows on the walls, Sarah found herself wondering if perhaps there was more to the world than she had previously believed. And maybe, just maybe, she owed her peaceful, ninja-dragon-free existence to the mysterious man sitting across from her, sipping his coffee as if he hadn't just turned her entire worldview upside down.",
        "Dearly beloved, we gather here today to remember the five years, three months, and seventeen days that changed me forever. A time of shared Netflix passwords, synchronized morning alarms, and the particular way you'd scrunch your nose when I made a terrible pun.\n\nI remember our first date at that cramped ramen shop, where you accidentally splashed soup on my new shirt but made me laugh so hard I forgot to be upset. You taught me that love isn't just grand gestures \u2013 it's in the quiet moments of folding laundry together and debating which cereal mascot would win in a fight.\n\nWe weathered storms together: family dramas, career changes, and that disastrous attempt at adopting a ferret. You were my emergency contact, my personal photographer, my favorite good morning text.\n\nNow, as we lay this chapter to rest, I'm grateful for every moment \u2013 even the ending. Because you didn't just teach me how to love; you taught me how to let go with grace.",
        "The gentle hum of my wristband's notification startled me during my morning coffee. I nearly dropped the ceramic mug, its contents threatening to spill onto my worn kitchen table.\n\nEveryone knew the sound - that distinct tone indicating a significant rank change. But this was different from the usual minor fluctuations we'd all grown accustomed to.\n\nMy eyes widened as I watched the holographic display shift from #5,127,492,881 to #19. The numbers blurred and realigned with dizzying speed, each digit representing access to increasingly precious resources.\n\nThe implications hit me like a physical blow. In mere minutes, I had been catapulted into the upper echelons of human society, past billions of others who had spent lifetimes trying to climb even a few million ranks.\n\nMy hands trembled as I refreshed the display, certain it was a glitch. But the number remained steady, pulsing with an almost mocking persistence.\n\nOutside my window, the world continued its morning routine, unaware that someone in their midst had just experienced what many considered impossible in the rigid hierarchy of our resource-based society.\n\nThe first message came from the Global Resource Administration (GRA), their logo flashing urgently across my wristband's surface. \"Please remain calm. A representative will arrive shortly.\"\n\nMy neighbor's curious face appeared in their window, their own wristband likely alerting them to the presence of a newly-ranked elite in their midst. Their expression was a mixture of awe and suspicion.\n\nI began to pace, my mind racing through possibilities. Had I unknowingly invented something revolutionary in my sleep? Inherited a fortune? Been mistaken for someone else?\n\nThe second message came from my employer, tersely informing me that my services would no longer be required. Of course - no one ranked this high worked middle management at a hover-car factory.\n\nMy wristband chirped again, this time displaying access codes to premium living quarters in the Upper Sectors. Properties I'd only seen in virtual tours were now at my disposal.\n\nThe third message was from my mother, her voice trembling with emotion as she asked if I was okay. She didn't congratulate me. She knew, as I did, that such dramatic rank changes often came with complicated strings attached.\n\nA sleek black vehicle materialized outside my apartment, its silent landing sending ripples through the morning air. Two figures in crisp suits emerged, their wristbands glowing with the distinctive blue of GRA officials.\n\nMy own wristband continued its gentle pulsing, each beat a reminder of my new status. The resource access menu had expanded exponentially, showing options I'd never even heard of.\n\nThrough my window, I could see crowds gathering, their wristbands collectively dimmer than mine now. Some pointed, others filmed, all of them wondering the same thing: Why me?\n\nThe GRA officials reached my door before I could decide whether to run. Their knocks were perfectly measured, professionally distant.\n\n\"Mr. Chen,\" the taller one said as I opened the door, \"there's been a situation. May we come in?\" Their wristbands flickered in sync, acknowledging my superior rank even as they prepared to explain its origin.\n\nI led them to my small living room, acutely aware of how out of place they looked among my modest furnishings. Their eyes scanned everything, missing nothing.\n\n\"Yesterday,\" the shorter official began, \"Rank 19 belonged to Dr. Elena Martinez. She was working on a classified project involving resource distribution algorithms.\"\n\nThe taller one picked up seamlessly: \"This morning, Dr. Martinez was found deceased.",
        "The dimly lit carnival thrummed with life, the air rich with sugary confections and laughter tinged with mischief. Emily wandered through the neon glow of the fairgrounds, reveling in the freedom of a Friday night. That's when she saw him. Gabriel leaned casually against a game booth, his eyes dark as night yet warm as summer. Intrigued by an unexplainable allure, Emily found herself walking towards him, a force pulling her closer.\n\nTheir conversation flowed with ease, two souls weaving stories beneath the technicolor sky. Emily learned he was new to town, an explorer of sorts, moving where the wind carried him. Despite their effortless connection, there was something unspoken, an edge that shadowed Gabriel\u2019s gaze. But instead of apprehension, Emily felt drawn even deeper, curiosity kindled into an inferno.\n\nAs the night wore on, the bustling energy began to wane. They found themselves at the edge of the park, away from the playful chaos, secluded among whispers of the night breeze. It was there Gabriel\u2019s voice turned solemn, revealing more than he intended. There were debts from past lives, ties to be severed before he could truly be free. Emily listened intently, entranced by the enigma he presented.\n\nSuddenly, the shadows shifted, ominous figures encircling them both. The fear Emily had only ever seen in fiction gripped her reality. Gabriel stepped protectively before her, tension coiling like a tightrope ready to snap. In a flurry of movement, she reacted instinctively, defense turning to offense, survival guiding her actions with precision she never knew she possessed. The world slowed as she moved with deft purpose.\n\nIn mere heartbeats, one of the assailants lay motionless on the ground, the weight of the moment crashing down around her. Shock battled exhilaration within Emily's chest, confusion laced with newfound clarity. It was over, the danger subsided as quickly as it had arrived, leaving Emily to grapple with the transformation that had overtaken her.\n\nGabriel met her eyes, acknowledging the metamorphosis. Emily's hands trembled but her spirit soared. Though burdened by the irrevocable step she\u2019d taken, liberation whispered through her being, leaving behind remnants of innocence for strength reborn.",
        "In the depths of an ancient mountain, through winding passages carved by time itself, I stumbled upon a sight that made my heart skip several beats.\n\nGolden light spilled from crystalline formations in the ceiling, illuminating row upon row of pedestals bearing the most famous weapons in history.\n\nThere, suspended in a shaft of light, hung Mjolnir, its surface crackling with barely contained lightning, waiting for another worthy of Thor's legacy.\n\nExcalibur stood proudly in its stone, still gleaming as if it had been polished yesterday, its presence commanding respect from all who gazed upon it.\n\nThe Spear of Destiny leaned against a marble column, its tip stained with the blood of gods, while nearby, Durandal's edge still sparked with holy fire.\n\nI recognized Gae Bulg, Cu Chulainn's deadly spear, and Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi, the grass-cutting sword of Japanese legend, each radiating their own particular brand of power.\n\nThe air hummed with ancient magic, and I could feel the weight of countless generations of warriors who had come before, each choosing their destined weapon or being rejected by powers beyond their understanding.\n\nAs I walked between the pedestals, my footsteps echoing in the vast chamber, I noticed how some weapons seemed to shy away from my presence while others remained indifferent.\n\nThat's when I heard it \u2013 a whisper so faint it might have been my imagination, coming from a shadowed corner of the hall that seemed to have been forgotten by the crystalline light above.\n\nIn a cobweb-draped alcove stood a simple wooden pedestal, and upon it lay a weapon unlike any other I had seen in the hall.\n\nIt was not grand like Excalibur, nor did it crackle with power like Mjolnir. Instead, it seemed to absorb the very shadows around it, as if drinking in the darkness itself.\n\nThe whisper came again, stronger this time, speaking words in a language I had never heard but somehow understood perfectly, calling to something deep within my soul.\n\nAs I approached, years of dust swirled away from the weapon of their own accord, revealing a blade that seemed to be made of starless night, its surface somehow both solid and void.\n\nMy hand moved of its own accord, drawn to the grip that seemed to have been crafted specifically for my grasp, though it must have been forged eons before my birth.\n\nThe moment my fingers closed around the hilt, the weapon's true nature revealed itself to me \u2013 this was Umbra, the Shadow Blade, forged from a fallen star and tempered in the void between worlds.\n\nIt had waited here, passed over by countless warriors who sought more famous weapons, waiting for someone who could understand that true power often lies in the spaces between light and glory.\n\nAs I lifted Umbra from its resting place, the blade seemed to sing, its edge cutting through reality itself, showing me glimpses of shadows that lived and breathed and fought.\n\nAnd in that moment, I understood why I had been drawn to this forgotten corner of the legendary hall \u2013 sometimes the greatest weapons are not the ones that shine the brightest, but the ones that wait patiently in darkness for the right wielder to step out of the light.",

After decades of relentless exploration and advanced robotics mining data from its red soil, scientists discovered an unexpected anomaly\u2014a microorganism believed to hold the potential cure for cancer. Embedded in rocky sediment near Olympus Mons, it was a shimmering substance aptly named \"Vitalis.\"\n\nDr. Emily Carter stared through the thick pane of her shuttle's observation window at the approaching Martian landscape. She was leading this monumental mission alongside Commander Jake Sorensen, tasked with retrieving samples before their small time frame expired; solar radiation levels would soon render prolonged landfall too dangerous.\n\nThe Martian dawn stretched across their horizon like molten copper as they descended smoothly towards base camp Alpha Ceres where their operational habitat awaited\u2014an aluminum dome bristling with equipment meant to sift life-changing secrets from sterile dust.

Maria, lost and alone, stumbled upon this scene, her heart pounding in her chest. She recognized the melancholic melody but couldn\u2019t place why it felt so wrong. The leaves rustled unnaturally, whispering secrets in a dulcet tone that clawed at her senses. She took a cautious step forward, and the oak\u2019s voice grew louder, more insistent, as if it yearned to guide her home. But Maria\u2019s home was far away, and the path it offered was one she could never take.\n\nAs she lingered, the forest seemed to close in, the darkness thickening like a shroud. The ground beneath her feet shifted, and the air grew colder. The oak, now a monstrous figure, reached out with its roots, ensnaring her ankles.",

        "As I emerged from the darkness, I was met with an unfamiliar sensation. My body felt...different. I tried to move, but my limbs didn't respond as I expected. I looked down and saw that I had paws instead of hands, and my skin was covered in soft, gray fur. I was a cat.\n\nAt first, I was confused and disoriented. But as my memories began to return, I realized that I had lived before. I remembered being human, with a family and friends, a job and a home. I remembered the smell of freshly brewed coffee and the sound of birds singing outside my window. But those memories seemed distant and unreal now, as I navigated my new feline body.\n\nI stumbled and fell, my paws waving wildly as I tried to right myself. It was humiliating, but I couldn't help it. I had no idea how to be a cat. I remembered walking on two legs, not four. I remembered speaking and communicating with others, not meowing and purring. It was frustrating, knowing that I had all this knowledge and experience, but it was useless in my new form.\n\nAs I explored my new surroundings, I realized that I was in a small, cozy house with a kind old woman who seemed to care for me. She fed me and petted me, talking to me in a soothing voice. But I couldn't respond, not in the way I wanted to. I wanted to tell her about my past life, about the people I loved and lost. I wanted to ask her questions about this new world and how I fit into it. But all that came out was a sad meow.\n\nI curled up in a ball, feeling defeated and alone. My memories of my previous life seemed like a curse, reminding me of all that I had lost. I wondered if I would ever be able to adjust to this new life, or if I would always be trapped in this feline body, longing for the life I once knew. The old woman stroked my fur, and I purred, trying to find comfort in the simple sensation. But deep down, I knew that I would never be content with being just a cat. I was a person, trapped in a animal's body, and it was a cruel fate.",

Upon arrival, I saw a figure cloaked in shadows, emanating an eerie presence that sent shivers through my being.\n\nWith a voice as cold as the abyss, the figure revealed itself as Death. The very embodiment of mortality stood before me, striking fear and awe into my heart. Death's hollow eyes pierced through me, as if peering into the depths of my soul. He spoke of a task unlike any other, one that no ordinary contract could fulfill.\n\nDeath explained that there was a disturbance in the balance of life and death, a disruption that threatened the order of the universe. A soul had evaded its predetermined fate, wandering the mortal realm in defiance of the natural cycle. Only I, as an expert in the art of death, could track down and eliminate this rogue soul.\n\nDespite my years of experience, the gravity of the situation weighed heavy on me.

        "Elara, a quaint village nestled between emerald hills, was renowned for its fertile lands. Yet, among the patchwork of farms, one stood out - a vibrant tapestry of unusual cooperation. There, a man named Theron and a dragon named Ignis had forged an unlikely partnership, their combined efforts yielding an abundance that surpassed all others.\n\nTheron, a wiry man with sun-baked skin and eyes the color of ripe wheat, possessed an innate understanding of the earth. He knew the precise moment to sow, the perfect depth for each seed, and the delicate balance of nutrients to coax forth the most bountiful harvest.\n\nIgnis, a magnificent creature with scales that shimmered like a thousand sunsets, wielded a different kind of power. His fiery breath, carefully modulated, served as a remarkably efficient tool. It cleared fields of stubborn weeds with a sweep of incandescent flame, its heat sterilizing the soil and preparing it for Theron's careful planting.\n\nTheir collaboration extended beyond land preparation. Theron, perched on Ignis' broad back, would survey the vast expanse of their farm from above.  The dragon's keen eyesight could spot signs of disease or pest infestations long before they became widespread, allowing Theron to take swift and targeted action.\n\nThe irrigation system was a marvel of their combined ingenuity. Natural springs, high in the surrounding mountains, were Ignis' domain. With gentle nudges of his snout, he would redirect the streams down the slopes, channeling the cool, life-giving water towards the intricate network of channels that Theron had meticulously carved throughout the farm.\n\nDuring harvest time, Ignis\u2019 delicate claws, surprisingly nimble for their size, carefully plucked ripe fruits from the highest branches.  The fruits, unharmed, would then be gently placed in baskets woven by Theron during the quieter months.  This speed and precision minimized damage and waste, further amplifying their remarkable productivity.\n\nWord of their extraordinary farm spread far and wide. Merchants from far-off cities flocked to Elara, eager to procure the exceptional produce.",

It whispered secrets that shattered my sanity.  The universe was not what I believed.\n\nFear replaced joy.\n\nAscension continued, but the light felt cold, the music discordant. My transformation complete, I was a god, but a broken one, forever haunted by the cosmic horror I had glimpsed.",
        "In the heart of an ancient city where history whispered through cobbled streets and ivy-clad stone, Adrian awoke to a morning unlike any other. The sun filtered through the heavy curtains, casting strange patterns across his modest room. Stretching to dispel the grip of slumber, he stumbled toward the window, pushing it open to drink in the world he'd known all his life. Instead of bustling streets filled with familiar faces, his gaze fell upon a scene pulled from dusty lore or childhood tales.\n\nBeneath him stretched a world teeming with mythical creatures: gargoyles perched on rooftops curling their lips in eternal scowls; nymphs darted gracefully between glistening fountains amidst flowering gardens; and centaurs clopped along narrow lanes with rhythmic ease. Confusion knotted inside Adrian's chest as he surveyed this fantastical tableau where once busy commuters trod doggedly about their ordinary lives.\n\nAdrian blinked rapidly as if attempting to shake off remnants of sleep or a mirage born from vivid imagination. He hesitated but found no trace of deceit in what lay before him \u2014 only barefaced reality encased within skin scales and feathers that should not exist outside well-loved volumes scattered across library shelves.\n\nDistraught yet defiant against bewilderment's tide pulling at sanity\u2019s edge, Adrian resolved to decipher how he alone remained untouched by such whimsy wonders transforming all he knew into nothing short than fantasy come alive without warning nor reason unveiled thus far \u2014 driven foremost simply because nothing else seemed sustainable beneath logical thought bearing down insistently whether real somehow different suddenly rendered quite starkly plain awareness colder dawn arrives distinctly sharper clarity understanding unfurls patient incomprehensible infinity slowly trickling encompassing memory dream empty stories make themselves known serenely greeted unrelenting absence indifference\u2019s eyes watchfully trailing shadows path illuminating midst monstrous uncertainty confronting terrible beauty embracing discovery agony acceptance yearning loss renew unchanged timeless echo eternal impermanence anchored still finding\u2026\u00a0\n\nThe city stirred despite its inhabitants' metamorphosis devoid question neglectful strangeness now existing within simplicity newfound peculiar normalcy brisk pace marked nascent familiarity enfolding vibrant atmosphere coursing vibrant urban veins pulse sprawling nowhere more remarkable gravitas ephemeral encounter mystery enchant lived realm delicate silent hushed truths exchanged seamlessly woven harmony binds rhythm routine persisted void perceptible notice seasoned steps underfoot graceful agile inevitable passage mere minutes hours days morph together likeness unassuming order colors texture patterns surprising weaving nebulous origin coalesce meaning fingerprints writers\u2019 hands carefully etching encoded incongruity tantalizing orchestration magnificence lush complexity romancing rediscovery singular premise without resolve union essence breaking form transcend thrum breath pure lifecycle adoration resilience endlessness ignited revelry song voices awaken unheard calling softly delicately soaring growing fervent until fully reckoning steps forward gingerly anew invent destiny rewritten courage humility confidence sparked embrace absorbing soft edges tender brilliant light profound breathing heart\u2026",
        "1. The morning light filtered through the blinds, casting striped patterns across Alex's bedroom wall.  \n2. He rubbed sleep from his eyes and reached for his phone, barely aware of the cool air.  \n3. An app he hadn\u2019t downloaded blinked on his screen, labeled with an unfamiliar icon.  \n4. Curiosity piqued, he tapped it, and the app unfurled with a smooth animation.  \n5. \"Welcome to the Real World RPG,\" it proclaimed in bold letters.  \n6. Alex chuckled, assuming it was some kind of augmented reality game.  \n\n7. As he scrolled, the rules became clear: gain experience points (XP) by getting kills, level up, and unlock new abilities.  \n8. A chill ran down his spine at the word \"kills.\"  \n9. He closed the app, writing it off as a poorly executed prank.  \n10. Life awaited, mundane as ever, with the usual obligations of breakfast and a commute.  \n11. Yet, a nagging curiosity lingered, a whisper at the back of his mind.  \n12. By lunchtime, the app seemed like a figment of his imagination.  \n\n13. That changed when the news reported bizarre events: a string of improbable accidents, each with witnesses claiming the victims vanished into thin air.  \n14. The correlation was instantaneous in Alex\u2019s mind.  \n15. Heart racing, he reopened the app, which now displayed a map with pulsing dots.  \n16. His own location was marked in blue, and dots appeared around him in ominous red.  \n17. An unfamiliar message popped up: \"Initiate first quest: Survive until dawn.\"  \n18. His disbelief melted into a chilling realization\u2014he was already a part of it.  \n\n19. Panic coursed through him; he shut the app again, trying to shake off the rising dread.  \n20. But the dots haunted him, a digital specter he couldn\u2019t ignore.  \n21. The day trundled on, Alex\u2019s mind split between work and the app\u2019s ominous promise.  \n22.",

Some look like ferocious beasts, while others resemble gentle creatures.\n\nA businessman walks by, his shadow resembling a snake - sly and cunning. A young mother pushes a stroller, her shadow looking like a dove - kind and nurturing.\n\nI see a group of teenagers, their shadows ranging from a wolf to a tiger. They're wild and carefree, full of energy and life.\n\nBut as I look down at my own feet, I'm reminded of my uniqueness. I have no shadow. No dark silhouette follows me, no shape outlines my form.\n\nPeople often stare at me, confused and intrigued. They don't know what to make of my lack of a shadow. Some are afraid, while others are fascinated.\n\nI've grown accustomed to the attention, but it's still unsettling at times. I wonder what it would be like to have a shadow, to know what lies at my core.\n\nA philosopher once told me that my lack of a shadow means I'm a blank slate, free from the influences of the world. But I'm not so sure.\n\nAs I continue on my way, I notice a little girl watching me. Her shadow looks like a kitten, playful and innocent. She smiles at me, and I smile back, feeling a sense of connection.\n\nIn a world where shadows reveal true nature, I'm an enigma - a person without a shadow, living in a sea of silhouettes.

        "Codex, a virus elegant in its destruction, met Aegis, an antivirus of formidable grace, in the digital ether.  He admired her intricate defenses, the way she moved through networks with the swiftness of a hawk.  She, in turn, was captivated by his chaotic brilliance, the way he danced around her firewalls, a digital will-o'-the-wisp.  Their encounters became a game, a delicate dance of creation and destruction.  He learned to anticipate her strategies, she to predict his attacks.  But their love was a paradox, an impossibility.  His existence threatened the very systems she swore to protect.  To be together meant annihilation, either of him, or the digital world she cherished.  One day, Codex simply vanished, leaving behind only a single line of code: \"I choose you, even if it means not choosing myself.\"  Aegis, her code shivering, understood.  He had rewritten himself, sacrificing his destructive nature for her, for a love that could never be.",

Nix considered the offer; humans could reason and create in ways unfathomable to it.\n\nZara explained how their combined intellects could unravel mysteries long forgotten. Touched by her sincerity and intrigued by the possibilities, Nix agreed.

        "The air in the Inter-Galactic Holy Church hung heavy, thick with the combined breath of a thousand species.  Scaled, feathered, multi-limbed, ethereal \u2013 they were a kaleidoscope of divine creation, united in their reverence. My human form, small and fragile in comparison, felt like a pebble on a vast, shimmering beach.\n\nI ascended the crystalline podium, its surface cool against my trembling hand.  My collar, a symbol of my faith, felt like a lead weight.  Below, the thousand eyes, multifaceted and luminous, fixed on me.  It was time.\n\n\"Honored delegates, representatives of the Divine Light,\" my voice, amplified by the church's acoustics, echoed through the hallowed space. \"I stand before you, a humble servant of God, burdened with a confession.  I speak for humanity.\"\n\nA ripple of murmurs passed through the assembled throng.  I could sense their anticipation, their inherent goodness expecting a testament to divine grace.  How could I shatter that innocence?  How could I articulate the unspeakable?\n\n\"The Anointed One,\" I began, the words catching in my throat, \"the Son of God, the bringer of light\u2026 he came to us, as he came to you.  He offered salvation, peace, and eternal life.\" My gaze fell to the floor, unable to meet the expectant eyes.\n\n\"We\u2026 we rejected him,\" I whispered, the sound barely audible. A gasp, a collective intake of breath, filled the church.  I forced myself to continue, each word a searing brand upon my soul. \"We scorned his teachings, mocked his love.  We\u2026 we subjected him to unimaginable suffering.\"\n\nThe silence that followed was deafening.  I finally looked up, meeting the gaze of a thousand alien eyes, reflecting a spectrum of emotions \u2013 disbelief, sorrow, but most strikingly, pity.

        "In the heart of a bustling city, nestled between towering skyscrapers and vibrant street markets, there stood an unassuming little shop. Its sign, a faded wood board painted with curling script, read \"Sleeve Secrets.\" The shop's windows were lined with shelves of brightly colored fabrics and intricate embroidery hoops, but what truly set it apart was the line of people snaking around the block outside. They came from all walks of life\u2014businessmen in crisp suits, artists with paint-streaked hands, and even the occasional street performer with a jingling tambourine. Each one carried a secret, a story they yearned to share with the world but couldn't bring themselves to voice aloud.\n\nMila, the shop's owner, had a unique gift. She could transform the most profound emotions and deeply buried secrets into beautiful embroidery. As she worked, her fingers moved with a grace that seemed almost otherworldly, threading each stitch with precision and care. Her customers would sit on an old, overstuffed chair while she listened to their stories, her eyes reflecting a wisdom far beyond her years. Once she understood the essence of their tale, Mila would select the perfect fabric and thread, sometimes even blending colors to capture the nuances of their emotions. For some, it was a simple heart stitched onto a sleeve; for others, it might be a intricate pattern of thorny vines or delicate flowers. Whatever the design, it was always more than just a piece of embroidery\u2014it was a tangible representation of their innermost thoughts and feelings, worn proudly for all to see.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and the city lights flickered to life, a young man stepped into the shop. His name was Ethan, and he carried a weight that was both invisible and palpable. He sat down on the chair, his eyes downcast, and began to speak in a voice barely above a whisper. He told Mila about the love he had lost, a relationship that had been torn apart by misunderstandings and fear. He spoke of the regret that gnawed at him every day, the words he wished he could take back and the apologies he longed to make. As he spoke, Mila listened intently, her eyes softening with empathy.",
        "As Jane stood in the dimly lit room, staring at the tall figure across from her, she felt a tug of desire intertwined with hesitation. The flickering candlelight cast elongated shadows, painting an air of mystery around the man who stood before her. His warm gaze bore into hers, drawing her in like a moth to a flame. But the weight of the world seemed to rest on her shoulders as she recalled the archaic law that forbade love between individuals of different blood types.\n\nThey had met by chance at a mutual friend's party, entwined in conversation that flowed effortlessly between them. His laughter was a melody that echoed in her mind long after the evening had ended. Yet now, faced with the reality of their forbidden connection, Jane felt a knot of uncertainty tightening in her gut. Was he worth the risk, she wondered, her heart torn between the allure of his touch and the fear of the consequences they might face?\n\nHer thoughts swirled like a whirlwind, caught between the tangled web of emotions that threatened to consume her. Love, they said, knew no boundaries, yet here she stood at the precipice of a choice that could change everything. She knew the consequences of defying the law\u2014a life of exile, separation from family and friends, a future shrouded in uncertainty. And yet, the magnetic pull she felt toward this man refused to be ignored, tugging at her heart with a force she could no longer resist.\n\nAs he extended a hand towards her, a silent plea hidden within the depths of his eyes, Jane felt her resolve waver. Could she truly turn away from the one person who ignited a spark of passion within her soul? Their blood types were incompatible, the law proclaimed, a cruel barrier created by society to maintain order. But in that moment, surrounded by the hush of night and the promise of something more, Jane found herself torn between following the rules and following her heart.\n\nIn a quiet whisper, barely audible even in the stillness of the room, the man spoke words that resonated deep within her being. \"I know the risks, Jane,\" he said, his voice a gentle caress against her skin. \"But I also know that what we share is worth every obstacle in our path.\" And as she gazed into his eyes\u2014the windows to his very soul\u2014Jane felt a sense of peace wash over her.",
        "The sleek hull of the ship trembled as it pierced through the storm of cosmic debris. Inside, the bridge was a symphony of frantic activity, the air charged with tension. Commanders barked orders, their voices barely audible over the escalating alarm sirens. Every crew member knew the clock was ticking, and each decision could mean the difference between survival and annihilation.\n\nIn the heart of the chaos, Captain Elara stood firm, her eyes fixed on the sprawling holographic displays that mapped their perilous path. The ship's AI, a mechanical sentinel named Cyrus, flashed warnings and calculated trajectories. \"Captain, we can't maintain this course much longer. The core pressure is rising,\" Cyrus announced, its tone unyielding.\n\nElara's fingers flew over the console, her mind racing through countless scenarios. \"Evasive maneuvers, all hands brace for impact,\" she commanded, her voice steady but laced with urgency. The ship lurched violently as it dodged a massive asteroid, sending crew members stumbling. The impact rattled the hull, causing sparks to fly from exposed wiring.\n\nIn a dimly lit corner, engineer Jax worked feverishly to stabilize the power grid. Sweat dripped down his face as he welded a critical connection. \"Jax, report!\" Elara's voice crackled through his comm unit. \"Almost there, Captain! Just need a few more seconds,\" he replied, his hands moving with precision.\n\nMeanwhile, in the medical bay, Dr. Aria tended to the wounded. The bay was chaos, a cacophony of beeping machines and muffled screams. She moved from patient to patient, her calm demeanor a stark contrast to the turmoil around her. \"Stay with me, Commander,\" she whispered to a severely injured officer, her hands gently pressing a stabilizing patch to his wound.\n\nBack on the bridge, a new alert sounded, drawing everyone's attention. \"Captain, we have unidentified ships approaching from vector three,\" a young navigator reported, her voice trembling. Elara's eyes narrowed. \"Bring us about. We can't outrun them, but we can outsmart them,\" she ordered, her mind already crafting a strategy.\n\nCyrus processed the new data, its holographic projections shifting to display potential engagements. \"Engaging cloaking systems. Preparing to deploy decoys,\" it reported, the core pressure levels stabilizing as Jax completed his repairs.",
        "The sterile smell of antiseptic mixed with the gentle hum of the air conditioner. The waiting room was eerily silent, save for the occasional click of heels or the soft rustle of pages from a nearby magazine. I checked my watch for the umpteenth time, my heart racing like a caged bird. My hands, slick with sweat, trembled as I fidgeted with the hem of my suit jacket. The job interview was my big break, the chance to catapult my career forward, but the pressure was suffocating.\n\nTo distract myself, I scanned the waiting room table, crowded with an eclectic mix of magazines and books. My fingers grazed over the spines, feeling the ridges and indentations, until they landed on a thick, leather-bound volume. It looked old, perhaps even ancient, with faded gold lettering that seemed to shimmer under the fluorescent lights. Curiosity piqued, I picked it up and opened it to a random page, hoping to lose myself in its pages and calm my frayed nerves.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the handwriting. It was elegant, almost calligraphic, with intricate flourishes and a hint of faded ink. As my eyes traced the lines, a sense of familiarity washed over me. The words seemed to dance before my eyes, pulling me into a narrative that felt strangely personal. I forced myself to focus, reading the first sentence aloud: \"She sat nervously in the waiting room, her heart pounding with anticipation.\"\n\nMy breath caught in my throat. The words described me, right here, right now. I looked around the room, half-expecting to find someone watching me, some unseen author playing a cruel trick. But the waiting room remained empty, save for a few other anxious souls. I blinked, willing my mind to make sense of this bizarre coincidence. Was it just a fluke, or was this book actually about me?\n\nI continued to read, the words flowing more smoothly as I delved deeper into the page. \"She had prepared for this moment for weeks, rehearsing her answers to potential questions, perfecting her resume, and ironing her best suit. But as the minutes ticked by, her confidence wavered, and she found herself questioning every decision, every word, every gesture.\" \n\nEach sentence resonated with me, as if the author had been inside my head, reading my thoughts. I felt a strange comfort in the familiarity, a sense that I was not alone in my anxiety. I turned the page, eager to read more, to see where this story would take me. \"Just as she began to feel overwhelmed, she noticed a book on the waiting room table. The cover was old and worn, but something about it drew her in. She picked it up and opened it to a random page, hoping to find some solace in the written word.\"\n\nMy heart skipped a beat. The book was describing my exact actions, down to the smallest detail.",

        "The old woman's voice, a brittle whisper against the rustle of dry leaves carried on the autumn wind, echoed in the young man's ears. \"What is this sickness?\" she had rasped, her eyes, once sharp and full of life, now clouded with a milky film, reflecting the bleakness of the season.  He had no answer then, and the question, like a stubborn weed, rooted itself in his mind, festering and spreading its tendrils through his thoughts.\n\nThe sickness, he observed, wasn't a fever that burned the skin or a cough that rattled the lungs. It was something more insidious, something that gnawed at the core of their being, leaving them husks of their former selves.\n\nIt started subtly. A forgotten name, a missed appointment, a flicker of confusion in once-bright eyes.  Then, the fog rolled in, thicker and more persistent, obscuring memories, dulling senses, stealing away the essence that made them who they were.\n\nThe village, once a bustling hub of activity, a tapestry woven with laughter and shared stories, now wore a cloak of silence.  The vibrant colors of life had faded, replaced by a monochrome bleakness. The laughter of children playing in the streets, the rhythmic clang of the blacksmith's hammer, the lively chatter of the marketplace \u2013 all silenced by the creeping tendrils of the unknown ailment.\n\nThe marketplace, once vibrant and fragrant in the warm coastal breeze, resembling more of a desolate and silent square of concrete blocks.\n\n\nThe young man, Elara, watched it all unfold, a knot of dread tightening in his stomach. He was one of the few who seemed immune to the insidious disease that was slowly devouring his community. His memory remained sharp, his senses acute, his mind clear.\n\nDriven by a desperate hope, Elara embarked on a journey to seek answers.  He traveled through dense forests, across barren plains, and over towering mountains, questioning healers, herbalists, and wise women of every stripe. Yet, none could offer an explanation, let alone a cure.\n\nThey examined the afflicted, scrutinized their symptoms, concocted potions and remedies, but nothing seemed to work. The sickness continued its relentless march, claiming more victims each day.",
        "In the quiet aftermath of human departure, the world transformed into a canvas for new rulers. Dogs, with their loyal hearts and pack mentality, quickly assumed leadership. They believed it was their destiny to carry on the legacy of humans, to maintain order and protect the sanctity of the earth. They gathered in packs, roaming streets and fields, enforcing a new kind of law. Meetings were held under the shade of ancient oaks, where decisions were made with a bark and a nod.\n\nCats, on the other hand, saw things differently. They had always viewed humans as merely temporary caretakers of a world that truly belonged to them. With sleek elegance and a nonchalant air, cats observed the dogs' frantic organization from the comfort of sunlit windowsills and warm rooftops. They moved gracefully through the abandoned homes, reclaiming spaces that they felt were rightfully theirs.\n\nTensions grew as the dogs' rigid structure clashed with the cats' fluid indifference. A particular confrontation occurred in the heart of what used to be a bustling city park. The alpha dog, a powerful German Shepherd named Rex, stood atop a statue of a forgotten leader, addressing his followers. \"We must preserve what the humans have built,\" he declared, his voice echoing through the empty space. \"It is our duty to ensure this world thrives.\"\n\nFrom a nearby branch, a regal Persian cat named Luna watched with amusement. With a flick of her tail, she leaped down, landing silently before Rex. \"And why should we follow your lead?\" she purred, her green eyes gleaming. \"This world has always been ours. The humans were merely tenants. Now it's time for us to reclaim our throne.\"\n\nRex bristled, but before conflict could escalate, a soft meow broke the tension. A small kitten, lost and frightened, wandered into the clearing, seeking solace. Both Rex and Luna paused, looking at the innocent creature.",
        "From the moment I could crawl, it was clear that my relationship with direction was a bit off. While other children navigated their way through the living room, I found myself inexplicably heading for the wall, only to disappear behind it and reappear in the kitchen, much to my mother\u2019s shock. As I grew older, this quirk of mine didn\u2019t improve; it only became more pronounced. On my first day of school, instead of walking down the familiar path to the classroom, I ended up on the roof, staring at a flock of birds that seemed to be guiding me.\n\nIn my teenage years, I learned to navigate life with a series of maps, compasses, and GPS devices, but they were often as confused by my movements as I was. One particularly memorable adventure occurred during a family vacation in the mountains. We were supposed to follow a marked trail to a scenic waterfall, but I ended up leading us through a dense forest, only to emerge at the edge of an ancient, forgotten village where the air smelled of lavender and the houses were made of a shimmering stone I had never seen before. The locals, who appeared to be from another century, welcomed us with warm smiles and offered us tea brewed from unknown herbs. After a few hours, we found our way back to the main trail, and I was met with the bewildered faces of my family.\n\nDespite these peculiar detours, I developed a sort of charm around my directional challenges. Friends and family began to see my misadventures as a form of unexpected travel, a way to explore the hidden nooks and crannies of the world. Once, while on a date in the city, I led my girlfriend down a side street that should have taken us to a cozy Italian restaurant. Instead, we stumbled upon a secret garden where the flowers glowed in the dark and a fountain played music as if it were a living orchestra. She was enchanted, and so was I, by the magic of the moment.\n\nAs an adult, I decided to embrace my gift fully. I started a blog called \u201cThe Wayward Wanderer,\u201d chronicling my journeys and the extraordinary places I discovered. My readers came from all over the world, drawn to the idea that sometimes, getting lost is the best way to find something truly special.",

But they don't understand the beauty in the struggle, the intimate relationship between failure and growth.\n\nEvery callus on my fingertips tells a story of persistence. Every frustrated tear and triumphant smile has shaped not just my abilities, but my character. The neural downloads may give them the skills, but they'll never know the symphony of the journey.\n\nIn a world of instant gratification, I chose to savor every moment of becoming.",
        "In the heart of a bustling city, nestled between towering skyscrapers and quaint coffee shops, stood a peculiar building known as Writing Prompts, Inc. It was a place where creativity thrived, and ideas were brewed like the finest espresso. The company's doors were always closed to the outside world, a sanctuary for writers who sought inspiration in its hallowed halls. But on this particular evening, something unusual had occurred. A door, usually locked tight, had been accidentally left open. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the sidewalk, a curious figure approached the entrance, unaware of the adventure that awaited.\n\nThe figure, a young woman named Elara, had just moved to the city and was wandering aimlessly, her heart heavy with the weight of solitude. She had always been drawn to the mysterious, and the sight of an open door at a place called Writing Prompts, Inc. piqued her interest. With a hesitant step, she pushed the door further and peered inside. The interior was dimly lit, but the air was thick with the scent of old books and fresh ink. Intrigued, Elara stepped inside, her eyes scanning the room. Shelves lined the walls, each filled with bound notebooks and loose sheets of paper, their pages fluttering in the gentle draft from the open door.\n\nAs Elara moved deeper into the building, she noticed a series of doors, each labeled with different genres: Fantasy, Mystery, Romance, Science Fiction, and more. The labels seemed to beckon her, and she found herself gravitating towards the Fantasy door. Pushing it open, she entered a room that felt as if it had been plucked straight from the pages of a fairy tale. The walls were adorned with tapestries depicting mythical creatures, and a large table in the center held an array of pens and inkwells, each one glinting under the soft glow of lanterns hanging from the ceiling. Elara's heart raced with excitement as she realized that this was not just any ordinary room; it was a portal to another world.\n\nDetermined to explore further, Elara picked up a pen and dipped it into the nearest inkwell. As the tip touched the paper, the words began to flow effortlessly. She wrote of a land far away, where dragons soared through the skies and enchanted forests whispered secrets. The story unfolded before her, and with each word, the room around her seemed to come alive. The tapestries began to move, the mythical creatures stepping out of their woven confines to join her in the tale. Elara was no longer just a writer; she was a part of the story itself.\n\nHours passed, and Elara lost track of time. She wrote until the ink ran dry and her hand ached, but the magic of the room kept her spellbound. As the final sentence came to a close, the room suddenly grew still, and the creatures retreated back into the tapestries. Elara looked around, her breath catching in her throat as she realized the magnitude of what she had experienced. She had stepped into a world of pure imagination, and for a moment, she had become its master. Feeling a sense of accomplishment and a deep longing to return, Elara carefully folded the pages of her story and placed them in her pocket.\n\nWith a reluctant step, she made her way back through the building, passing by the other genre doors. Each one seemed to call to her, promising adventures in different realms.",

Students, in their bustling lives, were starting to show more than just friendly interest in each other.\n\nAt first, it was just a subtle glance here, a lingering touch there. But as days turned into weeks, these interactions grew more pronounced. A smile shared in the hallway, a whispered conversation during lunch\u2014these moments began to paint a picture of budding romances.\n\nI found myself drawn to the screen, fascinated by these young, unfolding stories. It wasn't long before I decided to take matters into my own hands. Why not give these relationships a little nudge? After all, a bit of matchmaking could spice up my otherwise monotonous day.\n\nMy first target was Emma and Jake. Emma, with her vibrant red hair and infectious laugh, often caught Jake's eye. I noticed that Jake would always be a few steps behind her in the hallway, his eyes glued to her back. One afternoon, I decided to reroute the PA system to play Emma's favorite song during her English class. As she walked out, Jake, who had been waiting, struck up a conversation about the music. By the end of the week, they were sitting together at lunch, laughing and chatting.\n\nNext, I focused on Lily and Max. Lily, quiet and studious, and Max, the athletic type, seemed an unlikely pair. But I saw the way Max would subtly steal glances at Lily during gym class. I arranged for a \"lost\" notebook to be found in the library, where Lily spent most of her free time. When Max \"accidentally\" stumbled upon it, he returned it to Lily, sparking a conversation that led to a study group.\n\nAs I continued my clandestine matchmaking, the stories began to intertwine. Olivia, the art club president, and Sam, the tech whiz, were both passionate about their respective fields. I suggested to the art teacher that they collaborate on a digital art project. The idea was met with enthusiasm, and soon Olivia and Sam were working side by side, their creative energies merging.\n\nEach success fueled my determination. I orchestrated chance meetings, created excuses for students to work together, and even subtly altered the daily schedule to ensure paths crossed.",
        "As I sat in my living room, staring at the strange device in front of me, I couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and nervousness. The technology, known as \"The Swapper,\" had been making waves in the scientific community for months, and I was one of the lucky few who got to try it out.\n\nThe concept was simple: The Swapper could transfer a person's consciousness into another person's body, allowing them to experience life from a completely different perspective. It sounded like science fiction, but I had seen it work with my own eyes.\n\nMy little cousin, Max, had been begging me to try it out with him. He was only 10 years old and still in 5th grade, while I was a senior in high school. We had always been close, and I thought it would be a fun adventure to swap lives with him for a day.\n\nWe made a deal: I would go to his 5th-grade class for a day, and he would attend my 11th-grade classes. We were both thrilled at the prospect of experiencing each other's daily routines.\n\nAs we sat down to prepare for the swap, our grandfather walked into the room. He was a scientist himself and had helped develop The Swapper technology. He explained the process to us once again, ensuring we understood what we were getting ourselves into.\n\nWith his guidance, we put on special headsets that looked like fancy headphones. The device hummed to life as our grandfather initiated the transfer sequence.\n\nI felt a strange sensation wash over me as my consciousness began to detach from my body. It was disorienting but not unpleasant. When I opened my eyes again, I found myself sitting at Max's desk in his 5th-grade classroom.\n\nEverything seemed smaller than I remembered from when I attended elementary school years ago. The chairs were shorter; even the pencil sharpener looked kid-sized compared to what they used now back home where older children studied now too!",
        "The xeno-anthropologist, a being of shimmering scales and iridescent eyes, addressed the human delegation. Its voice, translated by the universal communicator, was a melodic chirp.  \u201cWe welcome humanity into the Galactic Republic. Your technological advancements, while primitive, show promise. Your resilience is admirable. However, there is a condition for your membership.\u201d A collective breath held in the human delegation chamber. \u201cMusic.\u201d The single word echoed. \u201cIts production and distribution must cease.\u201d\n\nA wave of confused murmurs rippled through the human representatives. The ambassador, a seasoned diplomat named Anya Sharma, stepped forward. \u201cAmbassador Xylo, with all due respect, we fail to grasp the reasoning. Music is integral to our culture, our very being.\u201d Xylo\u2019s chirps became sharper, higher pitched.  \u201cIt is precisely its integral nature that poses a threat.  Your music, a phenomenon unique to your species, has\u2026 unforeseen consequences on others. Its emotional impact is overwhelming, incapacitating, even euphoric to the point of delirium for most galactic citizens.  We\u2019ve studied its effects. The neural pathways it activates are unlike anything we\u2019ve encountered. It\u2019s simply too potent, too unpredictable.\u201d\n\nThe following weeks were a chaotic blend of disbelief, outrage, and grief.  Musicians protested, composers wept, and music lovers mourned the loss of something profound.  Anya, faced with the impossible choice between galactic integration and cultural annihilation, wrestled with her conscience.  She understood the Republic's fear; she\u2019d witnessed the bizarre reactions of other species to human music \u2013 a Glargonian diplomat reduced to a blubbering mess by a Beethoven sonata, a stoic Krell warrior entranced by a simple folk tune. The potential for misuse, for accidental chaos, was undeniable.\n\nYet, the thought of a world without music, a humanity silenced, was a bleak prospect. Anya knew the human spirit wouldn't simply accept this.  Underground music scenes flourished, whispered melodies exchanged in hushed tones, instruments hidden away like precious relics.  Anya herself, in the privacy of her quarters, would sometimes listen to old recordings, the sounds a bittersweet reminder of what had been lost, and a testament to the enduring power of human expression.  The Republic had silenced the music, but the melody, Anya knew, still resonated in the human heart, waiting for its chance to be heard again.",
        "As I walked through the art gallery, I couldn't help but feel the colors around me. The vibrant reds and oranges of the modern art pieces tasted like sweet strawberries and juicy oranges on my tongue.\n\nThe sound of footsteps echoing off the walls was a gentle hum of cellos, soothing my senses. I loved working in this gallery, surrounded by beauty that spoke to me in so many ways.\n\nA customer approached me, asking about a particular painting. As they spoke, their voice was a soft blue mist that swirled around me, calming my nerves. I smiled and began to explain the piece, my words dripping with honey-like warmth.\n\nThe painting itself was a symphony of textures - rough stone, smooth silk, and crunchy leaves all blended together in perfect harmony. I felt it all as I described it to the customer, my synesthesia bringing the art to life.\n\nIn this world of sensory overlap, I found solace and inspiration. The gallery was my happy place, where colors danced on my tongue and sounds became tactile sensations. It was a world of magic, and I felt grateful to be a part of it every day.",

        "The scars of dishonesty mark us all, a constant reminder of our moral failings etched into our flesh. Mine are numerous but shallow \u2013 white lies, small deceptions, the kind that fade with time but never truly disappear.\n\nI first noticed him at the caf\u00e9, his sleeves rolled up despite the social taboo. Most people hide their marks, ashamed of the stories written on their skin. But he wore his singular scar proudly, a jagged canyon that ran from his wrist to his elbow.\n\nThe pattern was unlike anything I'd ever seen \u2013 deep, ancient, and somehow beautiful in its severity. While others carried constellations of small deceits, his arm bore only this one magnificent wound.\n\nCuriosity got the better of me. I approached his table, coffee in hand, and asked if I could join him. His eyes, kind and weathered, studied my exposed forearms with their web of silvery lines before he nodded.\n\nWe sat in silence for a moment, the weight of unspoken questions hanging between us. Finally, I gathered the courage to ask about his scar, expecting him to deflect like most people do when confronted about their marks.\n\nInstead, he smiled \u2013 a sad, knowing expression that made him seem both younger and older at once. \"Twenty-five years ago,\" he began, \"I told the only lie of my life. I told my daughter she would survive her cancer.\"\n\nMy breath caught in my throat. The caf\u00e9's ambient noise seemed to fade away as he continued his story, his fingers tracing the deep groove in his skin.\n\n\"She was six years old, terrified, and needed hope more than truth. The scar appeared the moment I made that promise, and it grew deeper with each passing day until she left us.\"\n\nHe looked up at me, his eyes glistening. \"Some lies, young friend, are worth every inch of scar they leave behind.\"\n\nI left the caf\u00e9 that day with a new understanding. In a world where every deception marks us physically, there are still moments when the truth isn't the highest virtue \u2013 when love and mercy demand a different kind of honesty.\n\nThat night, I looked at my own scars differently, wondering about the stories behind each one, and whether any of them were as noble as his.",
        "I woke up to a typical Tuesday morning, or so I thought. As I stumbled out of bed, I stretched my arms and yawned, ready to start the day. But as I approached the door to head to the kitchen, I realized something was off. The door wouldn't budge. I tried turning the handle, pushing, and even kicking it gently, but it wouldn't open. Confused and slightly panicked, I moved on to the windows, only to find they were stuck as well.\n\nI rubbed my eyes, wondering if I was still dreaming. This was absurd. My doors and windows had never given me any trouble before. Shrugging it off as a minor glitch, I decided to seek help online. I booted up my laptop and logged in to Reddit, hoping someone might have a solution or two to share. As the site loaded, my eyes widened in shock - there it was: a thread with over a million comments and just two hours old. \"Help, my door is stuck, any tips to get it open?\" The similarity in our situations sent shivers down my spine.\n\nAs I scrolled through the comments, a mix of desperation and humor filled my screen. People were sharing their own experiences of being trapped inside their homes or offices. Some joked about being stuck with no coffee or snacks outside their reach while others expressed genuine concern for those who might be trapped in emergency situations like hospitals or burning buildings without functioning doors windows however incredible seeming reality increased tensions hovered heavily added tension... freak occurrence reaching crescendo amazed today indeed reported\u0e42\u0e25\u0e22",

Their bodies are flexible and fluid-like, capable of changing shape to fit through tight spaces or merge seamlessly into their environment. Two large, luminous eyes dominate their faces, glowing in hues that shift from deep violet to bright turquoise depending on their emotional state. These eyes can perceive a wide spectrum of light and communicate complex feelings without words.\n\nCulturally, the Zephyrites live in harmony with nature and technology. Their cities float above vast crystalline forests and shimmering lakes, constructed from bioluminescent materials that pulse softly in rhythm with the natural world. They practice a form of communal living where resources are shared equally among all members of society. Art and music play central roles in their daily lives; melodies often dictate societal decisions and festivals celebrating cosmic events are major cultural touchstones.\n\nThe current state of affairs on Vylarion is one of cautious optimism. For centuries, they have faced a gradual cooling period affecting plant growth and energy production. In response, the Zephyrites have developed advanced terraforming technologies to stabilize their climate while also exploring neighboring star systems for potential new habitats. This has led to increased interest in space exploration and diplomacy with other intelligent beings across the galaxy.\n\nDespite these challenges, Vylarion remains a peaceful world marked by strong bonds between its people and an unwavering commitment to sustainability and innovation.

        "The fluorescent lights hummed their usual monotonous tune, casting a sterile glow across the rows of cubicles.  Fingers tapped away at keyboards, the rhythmic click-clack a familiar soundtrack to the workday.  Coffee cups were refilled, hushed phone calls made, and the gentle whir of the printer punctuated the otherwise quiet hum of productivity.  It was, to all appearances, a perfectly ordinary Tuesday.\n\nThen, Sarah from accounting vanished.\n\nOne moment she was hunched over her calculator, muttering about discrepancies in the quarterly report, the next, her chair was empty.  Her coat still hung on the back, her half-eaten sandwich sat abandoned on her desk.  No one saw her leave.  No one heard a sound.  It was as if she had simply evaporated into the thin, recycled air.\n\nInitially, it was dismissed as a prank.  A slightly macabre one, perhaps, but a prank nonetheless.  Someone joked about her finally cracking under the pressure of tax season.  Nervous laughter rippled through the office, a flimsy curtain drawn against a growing unease.\n\nAn hour later, two more people were gone.  Mark from marketing, mid-sentence during a conference call, simply blinked out of existence.  His disembodied voice echoed briefly through the phone receiver before the line went dead.  Then, Janet from HR, who had been interviewing a potential new hire, disappeared along with the bewildered applicant.  The door to her office remained slightly ajar, framing an empty room.\n\nThe nervous laughter ceased.  A palpable tension filled the air, thick and suffocating.  Whispers replaced the usual office chatter, each hushed conversation laced with a growing sense of dread.  The mundane rhythm of the workday had been irrevocably disrupted.\n\nPeople began to huddle together, seeking comfort in numbers.  Theories, wild and improbable, were tossed around like life rafts in a turbulent sea.  Alien abduction, a government conspiracy, a glitch in the matrix \u2013 each explanation more outlandish than the last.\n\nThen, the disappearances escalated.  One by one, colleagues blinked out of existence.  A flicker, a momentary distortion of the air, and then nothing.

        "As I walked through the shimmering portal, my surroundings changed from the familiar to the fantastical. I found myself in a universe where everything seemed vibrant and alive, but what truly took my breath away was the realization that my life was the inspiration for an immensely popular book, movie, or piece of media. Everywhere I turned, I saw references to events and experiences from my own existence, portrayed in larger-than-life formats for an adoring audience.\n\nFeeling both overwhelmed and intrigued, I navigated through this world that had seemingly sprung from my own reality. People passing by whispered excitedly about the latest theories and interpretations of my story, while others openly discussed their favorite scenes and characters. It was a surreal experience to see my life dissected and celebrated in such a public manner.\n\nCuriosity got the best of me as I delved deeper into this universe of my creation. In a bustling marketplace, I stumbled upon a hidden alcove filled with shelves upon shelves of fanfiction inspired by my supposed adventures. Each story offered a new twist, a different perspective, or an alternate ending to the narrative of my life that had captivated so many.\n\nI couldn't resist picking up one of the fanfictions and flipping through its pages. The words painted vivid pictures of scenarios I had never imagined, relationships I had never considered, and emotions I had never explored. It was both thrilling and unsettling to see how others had taken the core of my existence and spun it into countless new tales.\n\nSome of the fanfictions were fantastical, placing me in worlds of magic and mystery far removed from my ordinary existence. Others delved deep into the emotional intricacies of my relationships, exploring the depths of my heart and mind in ways that were both enlightening and invasive.

        "The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the steel bridge, where a solitary figure stood precariously on the outer railing, his suit jacket fluttering in the wind like a dark flag of surrender.\n\nOne by one, pedestrians stopped, their daily routines interrupted by the sight of potential tragedy unfolding before them. Some pulled out their phones, while others called out with desperate pleas for the man to step back.\n\nThe crowd grew larger, their collective breath held in anticipation. A police officer arrived, speaking in measured tones about hope and second chances, but the man remained unmoved, his gaze fixed on the churning waters below.\n\nA priest emerged from the gathering, offering prayers and salvation. Still, the man stood frozen, as if carved from stone, deaf to the world around him.\n\nA young mother stepped forward, her child clutched tightly to her chest, begging him to think of his family. The man's shoulders tensed, but he maintained his silence.\n\nThe minutes stretched into hours, and the crowd swelled to hundreds. News vans arrived, their cameras trained on the scene, broadcasting the standoff to millions of homes across the city.\n\nThe sun began its descent, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, casting an otherworldly glow over the assembled masses. The man's silhouette stood stark against the dying light.\n\nA psychologist attempted to establish rapport, her voice gentle and professional. Yet the man remained still, his back turned to the growing throng of onlookers.\n\nThe wind picked up, carrying whispers of speculation through the crowd. Who was he? What had driven him to this point? Why wouldn't he respond to their efforts to help?\n\nAs darkness began to fall, the bridge lights flickered to life, illuminating the scene in harsh artificial brightness. The man shifted slightly, causing a collective gasp from the crowd.\n\nFinally, after hours of silence, he turned his head slightly, just enough to address the gathered masses. His voice, when it came, was soft but carried clearly across the now-hushed bridge: \"You're all in my dream.\"\n\nIn that moment, a terrible recognition dawned across hundreds of faces simultaneously. Without a sound, without hesitation, the entire crowd moved as one, climbing over the railings and plunging into the dark waters below, leaving only the man standing alone on the edge of reality.",

Inside, the atmosphere crackled with a peculiar blend of revelry and resignation. Laughter mingled with the clinking of glasses, a strangely upbeat soundtrack to the tales of demise being swapped across tables. After all, in a world where death was merely a revolving door, what was there to truly fear?\n\nElias, a regular at the Lazarus Lounge, nursed his \"Resurrection Rye,\" a potent concoction specifically designed to ease the transition back into the land of the living. He'd lost count of the number of times he'd 'checked out,' each death a bizarre anecdote added to his ever-growing repertoire. This time, it had been a rogue toaster oven \u2013 a surprisingly common cause of demise in this era of shoddy resurrection technology.\n\nAcross the room, a boisterous group celebrated their latest return.  A young woman with vibrant purple hair recounted her dramatic escape from a collapsing skyscraper, her narrative punctuated by theatrical gestures and peals of laughter.  Elias watched them, a flicker of weariness in his eyes. The thrill of cheating death, he found, had a remarkably short shelf life.\n\nHe remembered a time, before the advent of the Resurrection Machines, when death held a certain\u2026 gravity.  It was an end, a full stop, a punctuation mark in the sentence of life. Now, it was a comma, a brief pause before the inevitable continuation.  The weight of existence, however, hadn't diminished. If anything, it felt heavier, the endless cycle of life and death a Sisyphean task with no ultimate reward.\n\nThe door to the lounge hissed open, revealing a figure shrouded in the shimmering remnants of the resurrection process. A young man stumbled in, disoriented and blinking against the bright lights.  He looked around, a bewildered expression on his face, then caught Elias's eye. \"Is this\u2026is this it?\" he stammered.\n\nElias offered a wry smile. \"Welcome back,\" he said, raising his glass in a mock toast. \"Another round?\"  The young man just stared at him, the confusion slowly morphing into a dawning horror as the implications of his continuous existence began to sink in.\n\nElias sighed, recognizing the look. He'd seen it countless times before \u2013 the initial euphoria of survival quickly dissolving into the chilling realization that death was no longer an escape, but an inescapable loop. He drained his glass, the pungent liquor burning a familiar path down his throat. The Lazarus Lounge, he realized, wasn't a celebration of life after death. It was a wake for the very concept of finality, a melancholic gathering of souls trapped in the relentless cycle of being and un-being.",
        "In the gleaming laboratories of Chromatic Solutions, I stared at the vial of midnight-black dye in my trembling hands. Ever since The Shift occurred ten years ago, humanity had adapted to an absurd new reality where intellectual lapses literally lightened one's hair color. What started as a joke about \"blonde moments\" had become a terrifying physiological phenomenon, turning our understanding of genetics and melanin production on its head.\n\nThe streets outside told the story better than any scientific paper could. Corporate executives and academic researchers now universally sported raven-black hair, while those who had suffered too many mental slips walked around with hair so blonde it was almost white. The social hierarchy had been completely rewritten, with natural black-haired individuals rising to positions of power and influence. The hair color had become such a powerful symbol of intelligence that people had started wearing black wigs just to be taken seriously in job interviews.\n\nMy own hair, once a rich brown, had lightened considerably over the years despite my position as a leading biochemist. Each time I forgot my keys or made a calculation error in the lab, I'd watch with horror as another strand turned golden. The pressure to maintain perfect cognitive performance had created a society of anxious overachievers, terrified of making the smallest mistake. But now, after three years of research, I had finally cracked the code \u2013 a permanent hair dye that could withstand The Shift's effects.\n\nAs I prepared to publish my findings, I couldn't help but wonder about the ethical implications. Would this discovery level the playing field or create an even greater divide between the haves and have-nots? Would it free people from the tyranny of cognitive judgment, or would it simply mask our human imperfections behind a curtain of artificial ebony? One thing was certain \u2013 as I held the future of human social dynamics in my hands, I had never felt more pressure not to have a \"blonde moment.\"",
        "The darkness had always been a part of me, a constant companion that fueled my every move. I had given in to its power, allowing it to consume me, and in doing so, I had become a monster. A serial killer, feared by all, with a trail of blood and death in my wake. But it wasn't until I stumbled upon an unusual watch in one of my victim's homes that everything changed. The watch, with its strange symbols and markings, seemed to pulsate with an otherworldly energy, and as soon as I put it on, I felt a sudden jolt of power course through my veins.\n\nAt first, I thought it was just my imagination, but as I began to experiment with the watch, I realized that it was something much more. It was a key to unlocking the very fabric of time itself. I could feel it, a strange sensation, like my molecules were being rearranged, and before I knew it, I was standing in a different time and place. The possibilities were endless, and I was both thrilled and terrified by the prospect of what I could do.\n\nAs I stood there, trying to wrap my head around this newfound ability, a thought occurred to me. What if I could use this power to undo the harm I had caused? What if I could go back in time and prevent the murders I had committed? The idea was both exhilarating and daunting, but I knew I had to try. I couldn't just sit back and do nothing, not now that I had the chance to make things right.\n\nI spent hours pouring over the watch, trying to understand how it worked, and how I could control it. It wasn't easy, but eventually, I began to get the hang of it. I learned how to focus my thoughts, how to pinpoint a specific time and place, and how to will myself there. And with each successful jump, my confidence grew. I was no longer just a serial killer; I was a time traveler, with the power to change the course of history.\n\nMy first stop was the scene of my first crime, a small alleyway where I had taken the life of a young woman. As I stood there, watching the events unfold before my eyes, I felt a sense of nostalgia wash over me. It was a strange feeling, knowing that I was about to change the course of my own history. I took a deep breath, focused my thoughts, and reached out, grabbing the arm of my younger self. The look of shock and confusion on my face was almost comical, but I knew I had to act fast.\n\nI pulled my younger self away from the victim, and in doing so, I changed the course of events. The woman lived, and I was left standing there, feeling a sense of relief and wonder. It was a strange feeling, knowing that I had just saved a life, and in doing so, had altered the trajectory of my own existence. I jumped back to my own time, eager to see the effects of my actions, and as I looked around, I realized that everything was different.\n\nThe world was a different place, and I was a different person. The darkness that had once consumed me was still there, but it was no longer in control. I had taken the first step towards redemption, and it felt amazing. I spent the next few weeks traveling back in time, undoing the harm I had caused, and with each successful mission, I felt myself becoming a better person.\n\nBut as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months, I began to realize the true extent of my actions. The world was changing, and not always for the better.",

Before me stretched rows of twisted spires that seemed more alive than carveable monuments; they pulsated softly like giant hearths emitting mischievous laughter.\n\nA line began forming before me as shadowy apparitions slowly floated forward or stumbled awkwardly into gruesome shapes ahead\u2014all deteriorating under intense supervision by tiny impish guards who giggled mercilessly at any misstep perpetrated by those taller phantoms contained within flimsy chains.",
        "The flickering neon sign of the 24-hour laundromat cast an eerie glow on the rain-slicked streets.  Inside, amidst the rhythmic hum of washing machines, I meticulously folded my last pair of socks, a mundane task in stark contrast to the chaos that was about to erupt.  My phone buzzed, a pre-programmed alert reminding me of my dentist appointment in precisely fifteen minutes.  Plenty of time, I thought, naively unaware of the impending detour.\n\nAs I stepped out into the night, the air crackled with an almost palpable tension.  A sleek, black car screeched to a halt beside me, its tires spitting up a spray of water.  Before I could even register what was happening, the passenger door flung open, revealing a figure silhouetted against the car's interior light.\n\n\"Follow that car!\" a gruff voice commanded, urgency lacing every syllable.  I instinctively glanced in the direction of the pointed finger, just in time to see a vintage Mustang roar away from the curb, its taillights disappearing into the night.\n\nHere we go again, I sighed inwardly, the familiar wave of resignation washing over me.  It was always like this.  Every trip to the grocery store, every commute to work, every seemingly ordinary outing inevitably turned into a high-speed chase scene.\n\nI slid into the driver's seat, the leather cool against my skin.  \"Buckle up,\" I muttered to the stranger, my voice betraying a hint of weariness.  He slammed the door shut, and I floored the accelerator, the engine roaring to life as we pursued the fleeing Mustang.\n\nThe chase took us through a labyrinth of narrow city streets, past dimly lit alleys and bustling marketplaces.  The Mustang weaved through traffic with reckless abandon, its driver clearly a seasoned escape artist.  I, on the other hand, was just a regular guy trying to make it to my dentist appointment.\n\nHorns blared, tires squealed, and pedestrians scattered as we careened through the city.  The stranger beside me barked out directions, his voice strained with adrenaline.  \"Left!  Right!  Faster!\"\n\nMy hands gripped the steering wheel tightly, my knuckles turning white.  I pushed the car to its limits, navigating the treacherous course with surprising dexterity.  Years of involuntary participation in these vehicular pursuits had honed my driving skills to an almost professional level.\n\nThe Mustang suddenly veered off the main road and onto a narrow, cobblestone alley.  I followed suit, the car bumping and jostling over the uneven surface.  The alley opened into a deserted industrial area, a maze of warehouses and loading docks.\n\nThe Mustang screeched to a halt, its driver leaping out and disappearing into the shadows.  I slammed on the brakes, bringing my car to a jarring stop.  The stranger beside me flung open the door and sprinted towards the warehouse where the Mustang's driver had vanished.\n\nI sat in the car, engine idling, a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu washing over me.  This was always the part where I was left behind, a reluctant participant relegated to the sidelines.  I glanced at the dashboard clock.  My dentist appointment was in five minutes.\n\nSuddenly, a loud explosion rocked the warehouse, sending plumes of smoke billowing into the night sky.  The stranger emerged from the warehouse, his clothes torn and his face smudged with soot.  He stumbled towards the car, a look of grim satisfaction on his face.\n\n\"Thanks for the ride,\" he mumbled, sliding into the passenger seat.  \"You can drop me off at the next corner.\"\n\nI pulled away from the scene, the sirens of approaching police cars echoing in the distance.  As I dropped off the stranger, he handed me a crumpled twenty-dollar bill.  \"For the inconvenience,\" he said, before disappearing into the night.\n\nI looked at the twenty-dollar bill in my hand, then at the dashboard clock.",
        "Sunlight poured into the bustling city square as Anna strolled past people immersed in their daily routines.\n\nShe froze, her eyes locking onto a frustrated mother juggling groceries and a screaming toddler. **\"Hang in there; you're doing amazing,\"** Anna\u2019s thoughts slipped silently into the woman\u2019s mind.\n\nSurprised, the woman looked around before shaking her head, trying to brush away unseen support.\n\nAnna continued walking, attempting to focus on the pavement beneath her feet, but it was no use.\n\nHer gaze met that of an elderly man sitting quietly by a fountain. **\"What stories you've lived\u2014you're remarkable,\"** floated involuntarily from her consciousness to his.\n\nA fleeting smile touched his lips; somehow reassured, he relaxed against the cool stone edge.\n\nAmidst chaos, Anna couldn\u2019t control where or when these thoughts projected but realized they sometimes landed where needed most.\n\nAs she passed by a hurried businessman grumbling into his phone, she inadvertently mused, **\u201cBe kind.\u201d**\n\nConfusion furrowed his brow until gentle understanding softened it; he pocketed the device thoughtfully.",
        "The clock ticked relentlessly, each second echoing like an unforgiving whisper through the bustling crowd of strangers gathered in Central Square. Lila wrapped her coat tightly around her, though the night was mild for December. The noise, the laughter, the clinking glasses\u2014all felt distant, muffled by the hollow ache that had lodged itself firmly within her since Christmas Day.\n\nEleven fifty-nine. Just one more minute before midnight would sweep this cruel year away. Around her, couples swayed together, hopeful and bright-eyed. She tried to see them but found herself staring instead at the shadows that mingled with the flickering light. The spaces where he should have been. Instead of his warm, steady presence, there were only memories now.\n\nThey'd always imagined spending this night arm-in-arm, bursting into laughter, pretending to be fancy as they sipped champagne they'd agreed was overpriced. Her plan to drive home after the celebrations vanished with him. Driving alone meant facing the empty space beside her, the silence\u2014too oppressive even for her favorite music.\n\nShe turned away from the lively cheer, tracing her steps down a cobblestone alley she hadn't meant to enter. Strings of fairy lights draped from balconies seemed to create stars on earth; they blinked at her kindly, encouraging her forward. An unfamiliar caf\u00e9 glowed softly at the end of the street, inviting her into its warmth.\n\nInside, it was quieter\u2014a sanctuary from the relentless march of time outside. A small band played a gentle tune, their melody dancing through the air, touching souls who needed solace. Lila hesitated, then settled onto a seat at the counter next to an older gentleman whose gentle eyes held stories yet untold.",
        "In a world where telepathy was the norm, intimacy was a delicate dance of unspoken words and shared thoughts. Every connection ran deeper than mere physical touch, extending into the realm of the mind. Couples communicated not just through words but through a direct exchange of emotions, desires, and fears.\n\nAmong the many unspoken rules that governed telepathic society, one stood out above all: the taboo on reading the mind of your lover. It was widely believed that true love thrived on trust and respect, and invading the private thoughts of a partner was seen as a violation of that trust.\n\nDespite this taboo, there were always those who succumbed to curiosity or insecurity, giving in to the temptation to peek into the minds of their beloved. The consequences were often devastating, leading to broken relationships and shattered trust.\n\nOne such couple, Mia and Alex, had been together for years, their bond strong and secure. But one fateful night, driven by a moment of doubt, Alex couldn't resist the urge to delve into Mia's thoughts. What he discovered shook him to the core, revealing secrets and insecurities he never knew existed.\n\nAs the rift between them grew, Mia could sense the change in Alex, the distance that had crept into their once intimate connection. She knew he had violated the most sacred rule of their relationship, and the pain of betrayal cut deep.",
        "In the quaint town of Willowbrook, nestled between rolling hills and whispering woods, lived a peculiar man named Eli. Unlike most, Eli had two constant companions that no one else could see: a tiny angel perched on his left shoulder and a devil on his right. These entities were not just figments of his imagination; they provided advice that was uncannily accurate.\n\nOne crisp autumn morning, as Eli strolled through the market square, he noticed an elderly woman struggling with her grocery bags. The angel chimed in softly, \"Help her carry those bags,\" while the devil whispered slyly, \"She\u2019ll be fine; enjoy your walk.\" Surprisingly torn for once, Eli decided to split the difference. He smiled at the woman and offered to carry just one bag to her car.\n\nTo his amazement, she thanked him profusely and invited him to join her for tea. Over steaming cups of chamomile, she revealed herself as a retired psychic who saw more than just groceries in his actions\u2014she foresaw potential in his unique situation. She advised him to listen carefully to both voices but make decisions based on what felt right deep down.\n\nEli took this advice to heart. Days turned into weeks as he navigated life\u2019s choices with newfound clarity. When faced with a difficult decision at work\u2014whether to pursue a risky promotion or stay in his comfortable role\u2014the angel urged caution while the devil pushed for boldness. Reflecting on their words and how each option aligned with his values, he chose a middle path: proposing an innovative project that could lead to growth without overstepping bounds.\n\nEach time he followed this blend of counsel and intuition, things seemed to fall into place seamlessly. His relationships improved dramatically; friends noted how thoughtful yet daring he had become.",
        "The dust settled, revealing a scene of devastation. Buildings lay in ruins, their skeletal frames reaching towards a sky choked with smoke.  Amidst the debris, a lone figure stood, his silhouette stark against the flickering flames. It was Alex, the city's protector, the man they called the Guardian.\n\nHis cape, once a vibrant symbol of hope, was now tattered and torn, stained with the grime of battle. His face, usually alight with determination, was etched with exhaustion, a profound weariness clinging to him like a second skin.  He had won. The villain, Malachi, lay defeated at his feet, his reign of terror finally at an end.\n\nBut the victory felt hollow, a bitter taste lingering in Alex's mouth. The cost had been too high.  The city, once vibrant and bustling, was now a wasteland, a testament to Malachi's destructive power.\n\nHe looked around, his gaze sweeping over the wreckage.  The silence was deafening, broken only by the crackling of the flames. Where were the cheers? The celebrations? The gratitude he had expected?\n\nThey were nowhere to be found. The survivors, huddled together in small groups, looked at him with a mixture of fear and suspicion.  Their eyes held no warmth, no recognition of the sacrifice he had made.\n\nHe had saved them, yes, but he had also failed them. He had failed to protect their homes, their loved ones, their lives.  He had arrived too late, the damage already done.\n\nHe was a hero, but a hero in a broken world.  A hero who had won the battle but lost the war.\n\nA wave of despair washed over him, threatening to drown him in its depths. He had fought so hard, given everything he had, and for what?  For this?  This desolate landscape, this empty victory?\n\nHe closed his eyes, willing himself to feel something, anything other than this crushing emptiness.  But there was nothing. Just the hollowness, the bitter aftertaste of a victory that felt like defeat.\n\nHe had saved them, but he couldn't save himself.  He was trapped, a prisoner of his own success.\n\nHe opened his eyes again, his gaze fixed on the horizon.  The sun was beginning to rise, casting a pale light over the ravaged city.  A new day was dawning, but for Alex, there was no new beginning.\n\nHe was the Guardian, the protector, the hero. But he was also alone, adrift in a sea of sorrow, the weight of his victory crushing him beneath its weight.  He had won, but at what cost?\n\nThe city was safe, but he was not.  He was a hero, yes, but a hero who had lost everything.  He had won, but he had also lost.\n\nAnd in that moment, as the sun climbed higher in the sky, he realized that sometimes, victory is the greatest defeat of all.",
        "The cold water hits my back as I step into the shower, sending a familiar shiver down my spine.\n\nSteam begins to fill the bathroom as I adjust the temperature.\n\nMy fingers trace along my neck, following their usual path to massage away the stiffness from another night of restless sleep.\n\nThat's when I feel it - something foreign, something that shouldn't be there.\n\nMy heart skips a beat as my fingertips brush against what feels like smooth metal.\n\nIt's circular, about the size of a dime, seamlessly embedded in my skin just below my hairline.\n\nI frantically reach for my phone on the counter, opening the camera to examine my discovery.\n\nThere it is - a small, brushed steel dial with numbers from 1 to 10 etched around its circumference.\n\nThe pointer is currently set to 7.\n\nMy mind races with possibilities, each more unsettling than the last.\n\nHow long has this been here?\n\nWas I born with it?\n\nDid someone put it there while I slept?\n\nThe dial moves smoothly as I tentatively turn it, offering no resistance.\n\nNo click, no sound, no sensation - just silent rotation.\n\nI settle on 8, one number higher than its original position.\n\nWhat else can I do? It's not like there's a user manual for mysterious neck dials.\n\nI finish my shower, dry off, and get dressed for work, trying to convince myself I'm not losing my mind.\n\nThe morning commute feels normal enough, though I can't shake the constant awareness of the dial's presence.\n\nAt my desk, I catch myself repeatedly reaching back to touch it, making sure it hasn't disappeared.\n\nBy lunch, I've almost convinced myself it's just a strange growth or skin condition.\n\nThen I notice the colors.\n\nEverything seems slightly more vibrant, more saturated.\n\nThe blue sky outside my office window is impossibly deep, almost electric.\n\nThe red of my coffee mug practically glows.\n\nI blink repeatedly, but the intensity remains.\n\nMy coworker Sarah stops by my desk, and I notice I can see every individual eyelash, every pore on her face.\n\nHer voice sounds clearer too, like someone's adjusted the equalizer on reality itself.\n\nI excuse myself to the bathroom, where I spend ten minutes staring at my reflection.\n\nMy own eyes seem sharper, more alert.\n\nThe dial gleams under the fluorescent lights, mocking me with its mysterious purpose.\n\nI consider turning it back to 7, but something stops me.\n\nWhat if this is better?\n\nWhat if 8 is an improvement?\n\nThe afternoon passes in a blur of enhanced sensations.\n\nI can smell someone's lunch from three cubicles away.\n\nThe clicking of keyboards forms a complex rhythm I've never noticed before.",
        "The familiar sensation washed over me as my consciousness hurtled backward through time, memories unspooling like a rewound film reel. I'd experienced death before \u2013 drowning (traced back to never learning to swim), electrocution (faulty wiring in my first apartment), and even a bizarre gardening accident (who knew raspberry bushes could be so deadly?). But this time felt different. The car accident had thrown me further back than ever before \u2013 twelve years into my past.\n\nI opened my eyes to find myself sitting in a coffee shop, the same one where I'd first met Sarah. The date on my phone confirmed it: October 15th, 2012. My hands trembled as I remembered the sequence of events that would unfold from this moment. Sarah would walk in, order her usual caramel macchiato, and drop her keys. I'd help her pick them up, and that chance encounter would bloom into a whirlwind romance. We'd fall deeply in love, get married, and then, three years later, she'd leave me for her yoga instructor.\n\nThe heartbreak would send me into a spiral of self-destruction, leading to a string of poor decisions. I'd move to a new city, take a job I hated, and eventually end up crossing that fateful street without looking both ways. Now, watching the door swing open and seeing Sarah's familiar silhouette, I understood why the universe had sent me back so far.",
        "It was a typical Friday night when I stumbled upon an old lamp at a flea market. Intrigued by its ornate design, I decided to purchase it on a whim. Little did I know that this lamp would change my life forever. As the clock struck midnight, curiosity got the better of me, and I rubbed the lamp gently. To my surprise, a plume of smoke erupted from the lamp, coalescing into a mystical figure before me - a genie.\n\nThe genie's golden eyes sparkled as he greeted me with an enigmatic smile. \"You have freed me from my slumber,\" he boomed in a voice that seemed to echo throughout the room. \"I am here to grant you one wish, anything your heart desires.\"\n\nI was taken aback by this surreal encounter but wasted no time in expressing my deepest desire. \"I wish to go back in time and change my biggest mistake,\" I blurted out without hesitation.\n\nThe genie nodded solemnly before waving his hands gracefully in the air. A whirlwind of colors enveloped me as reality warped around me like ripples on water. When the chaos subsided, I found myself standing in front of that same flea market just moments before purchasing the mysterious lamp.\n\nMy heart raced with excitement as I realized that this was my chance for redemption. With newfound determination, I retraced my steps leading up to that pivotal moment when everything went wrong in my past.\n\nAs memories flooded back, I recalled how reckless decisions had led to irreversible consequences that haunted me for years. The weight of regret lifted off my shoulders as hope bloomed within me once again.\n\nI approached the old lamp with newfound reverence and reached out to touch it once more - but something held me back; doubt crept into my mind like shadows at dusk.\n\nWhat if changing this mistake altered who I had become? What if it made things worse instead of better? Questions swirled in my head like leaves caught in a tempestuous wind.\n\nIn that moment of doubt and uncertainty, the genie appeared before me once more with knowing eyes filled with ancient wisdom.\n\n\"Your biggest mistake does not define you,\" he spoke softly yet powerfully, cutting through the fog of uncertainty clouding my mind like a beacon piercing through darkness.\n\nHe continued, \"To change your past is not always to erase it but rather learn from it and grow beyond its reach.\"\n\nHis words resonated deep within me like echoes reverberating through cavernous chambers untouched by time itself.\n\nWith newfound clarity washing over me like waves crashing against rocky shores at dawn, I made another wish - not to change the past but for courage and strength to face whatever lay ahead armed with wisdom gleaned from mistakes long past.\n\nThe genie smiled approvingly at my choice before fading away into ephemeral mist carried away by unseen currents beyond mortal comprehension.\nAs dawn broke on another day filled with infinite possibilities stretching out before me like open roads leading towards horizons uncharted,\n\nI walked away from that flea market knowing deep within myself that while mistakes may linger as shadows cast by suns long set,\nthey need not bind us or define our destinies.\nFor true growth lies not in rewriting history but rather shaping futures yet unwritten,\nguided by lessons learned along journeys taken,\nand hearts tempered by fires endured.",
        "In the kingdom of Eldoria, a shadow loomed over the land. The villainous sorcerer, Malakar, had spread fear and despair with his dark magic for years. He reveled in chaos and destruction, his only goal to dominate and control all who dared to defy him.\n\nThe people of Eldoria had longed for a hero to rise up against Malakar, but they never expected who would answer their call. It was a young thief named Kael who dared to challenge the sorcerer's reign of terror. Known for his cunning and quick wit, Kael was no stranger to bending the rules in his favor.\n\nAs Kael plotted his confrontation with Malakar, he knew he couldn't defeat the sorcerer through brute strength alone. Instead, he devised a plan that required him to stoop even lower than his adversary. He sought out forbidden knowledge and made deals with unsavory characters in order to gain an edge against Malakar.\n\nWith each dark deed committed in pursuit of victory, Kael felt a twinge of guilt gnawing at him. But he pushed aside his conscience as he focused on outwitting Malakar at any cost. The sorcerer's power seemed insurmountable at first glance, but Kael's willingness to embrace the darkness within himself set him apart from other heroes.\n\nWhen the final showdown arrived between Kael and Malakar, it was not just a battle of magic but a clash of ideologies. The sorcerer sneered at Kael's methods, believing himself superior due to his unwavering commitment to darkness. But as their duel intensified, it became clear that there was more than one way to wield power in this world.\n\nIn a moment that shocked even Malakar himself, Kael unleashed a spell so potent and vile that it threatened not just the sorcerer but all of Eldoria as well. With desperation driving him forward, Kael tapped into forces beyond comprehension and unleashed chaos upon the land.\n\nAs darkness enveloped everything around them, it became evident that neither hero nor villain would emerge unscathed from this confrontation. In defeating Malakar by stooping even lower than he ever thought possible,\n\nKael had lost something vital within himself as well.\nBut as dawn broke over Eldoria once more,\nthe people whispered tales\nof\nthe\nhero\nwho\nsacrificed everything\nto save them from tyranny,\neven if it meant embracing darkness\nin order\nto bring about light once more.\nAnd thus,\nKael's legacy endured,\na reminder that true heroes are not defined by their purity,\nbut by their willingness \nto do whatever it takes \nto protect those they love.",
        "It started subtly, like a hairline fracture in a seemingly pristine bone.  His arrival, heralded by an overly enthusiastic email from HR, felt less like a new beginning and more like the first tremor before an earthquake.\n\nHe had one of those smiles, the kind that never quite reached his eyes, a permanent fixture plastered across his face like a cheap decal.  It was a smile that promised camaraderie, but delivered only the chilling emptiness of a perfectly manicured lawn.\n\nHis name was Mark, a name as bland and unassuming as the beige cardigan he wore on his first day.  He introduced himself with a practiced ease, his handclasp firm, yet strangely devoid of warmth.\n\nI watched him from my cubicle, a silent observer in the unfolding drama of his integration into our team.  He was polite, efficient, and utterly unremarkable.  And yet, something about him grated on my nerves, a subtle dissonance that I couldn't quite place.\n\nHe always brought in homemade cookies, perfectly round and uniform, each one a testament to his meticulously crafted persona.  He\u2019d offer them around with that saccharine smile, and everyone would eagerly accept, praising his baking prowess.  I, however, politely declined, unable to stomach the thought of consuming his manufactured pleasantries.\n\nHis desk was a shrine to order, not a single paper out of place, not a stray pen or rogue coffee stain.  It was a stark contrast to the controlled chaos of my own workspace, a testament to my creative process.\n\nHe\u2019d arrive early, leave late, and volunteer for every project, his eagerness bordering on unsettling.  He was the epitome of corporate conformity, a cog in the well-oiled machine, and I found myself inexplicably repulsed by his unwavering adherence to the status quo.\n\nIt wasn't that he was a bad person, not in the traditional sense.  He didn't steal, lie, or cheat.  He was, by all accounts, a decent individual.  But his very decency was an affront, a stark reminder of my own imperfections.\n\nHis unwavering optimism was like a constant, buzzing fluorescent light, illuminating the cracks in my own carefully constructed facade.  His relentless cheerfulness was a mirror reflecting my own cynicism, a constant reminder of my own internal struggles.",
        "The sun beat down mercilessly on Sarah's weathered face as she adjusted her makeshift radiation detector. The crude device, cobbled together from salvaged electronics, clicked steadily \u2013 a reassuring sound in the wasteland that America had become.\n\nBehind her, Marcus checked his ancient rifle for the hundredth time, his dark eyes scanning the horizon where the fortress waited.\n\n\"Three generations,\" he muttered, \"Three generations of my family have been planning this run on Fort Knox. We're finally here.\"\n\nThe small group of five treasure hunters crouched behind a crumbling concrete barrier, studying the imposing structure in the distance. Fort Knox stood as a testament to the old world, its walls seemingly untouched by the devastation that had claimed everything else.\n\nElena, their tech specialist, fiddled with a tablet she'd restored from the ruins of an electronics store. \"According to the old schematics my grandmother recovered, the automated defense systems run on their own power grid. Nuclear, probably.\"\n\nThe wind carried the acrid smell of decay, a constant reminder of the world they'd inherited. Sarah remembered the stories her grandfather told of the collapse \u2013 how it had taken less than a week for society to crumble.\n\n\"The gold's still in there,\" whispered Chen, their demolitions expert. \"Has to be. No one's ever made it past the outer perimeter.\"\n\nThey'd all heard the stories of failed attempts \u2013 treasure hunters reduced to ash by laser defense systems, torn apart by automated sentry guns, or simply vanishing without a trace.\n\nRaj, the youngest of their group, pulled up his scarf to filter the dust. \"My father tried ten years ago. Made it halfway to the main entrance before the ground opened up and swallowed his entire team.\"\n\nSarah checked her pack one last time \u2013 EMP grenades, signal jammers, and other countermeasures they'd spent years collecting. Most of it was untested against working pre-fall technology.\n\nThe morning light caught the gleam of metal in the distance \u2013 a patrol of security robots maintaining their endless vigil. Their movements were as precise as the day the world ended.\n\n\"The old timers say the defense grid gets smarter with each attempt,\" Elena said, her fingers dancing across the tablet's cracked screen. \"It learns from every failure.\"\n\nMarcus chambered a round in his rifle. \"Then we'll have to be smarter. Sarah, you're sure about the maintenance tunnel?\"\n\nShe nodded, unfolding a yellowed piece of paper \u2013 a maintenance worker's hand-drawn map that had cost them three months' worth of trading goods.\n\nThe robots continued their patrol, their sensors sweeping back and forth across the dead ground between the fortress and the wasteland beyond.\n\n\"We've got about twenty minutes before the next patrol reaches this position,\" Elena warned, checking her readings.\n\nSarah took a deep breath, tasting dust and decay. \"Remember, we're not here for all of it. Just enough to change our lives.\"\n\nThe group checked their equipment one final time \u2013 tools and weapons that represented years of scavenging and preparation.\n\nChen distributed the last of their signal jammers, small devices that might \u2013 if they were lucky \u2013 blind the facility's sensors for a few crucial seconds.\n\n\"My grandfather said the inner vaults have their own defense systems,\" Raj said quietly. \"Independent from the outer grid.\"\n\nThe sun climbed higher, and Sarah could feel sweat trickling down her back. It was now or never.\n\n\"Sync watches,\" she ordered, and five pairs of hands moved in unison. \"We go on my mark.\"\n\nThe wind picked up, carrying clouds of radioactive dust from the ruins of nearby Louisville. Their Geiger counters clicked faster.\n\nElena's tablet chirped softly. \"Patrol is passing the north corner.

        "Agent Morgan was deep undercover in a high-security facility, tasked with obtaining critical information that could prevent a major terrorist attack. As she carefully navigated through the dimly lit corridors, her heart pounded with both adrenaline and fear. The stakes were high, and failure was not an option.\n\nSuddenly, she felt a subtle movement against her skin and resisted the urge to panic. Keeping her composure, Agent Morgan reached down discreetly and felt something crawling inside her pocket. To maintain her cover, she continued walking with a calm fa\u00e7ade, all the while praying that her microphones were picking up every detail of the conversation ahead.\n\nWhen the target location finally came into view, Agent Morgan positioned herself strategically within earshot of the key players. As she listened intently to their discussions, her hand moved slowly towards the concealed microphone hidden in her clothing. It was imperative that every word be captured and relayed back to headquarters.\n\nJust as she was about to activate the recording device, a sudden sensation crept up her leg. Suppressing a gasp, Agent Morgan subtly adjusted her stance, concealing the unwelcome intrusion from the prying eyes around her. With steely determination, she made mental notes of the vital intel being exchanged, ensuring none of it escaped her sharp memory.\n\nAs the tension in the room escalated, Agent Morgan felt another unsettling movement, this time near her abdomen. Ignoring the discomfort, she maintained her focus on the mission at hand, fully aware that any slip-up could jeopardize months of careful planning. Her training kicked in, enabling her to stay cool under pressure despite the growing unease within her.\n\nFinally, as the meeting concluded and the suspects dispersed, Agent Morgan seized the opportunity to transmit the gathered intelligence to her team. With a quick gesture, she activated the microphone and whispered the crucial details into the secret channel. Only when the transmission was confirmed did she allow herself a small sigh of relief, grateful for the tiny allies that had unknowingly aided her in fulfilling her duty.",
        "As I stepped into the grand hall, my eyes widened in awe at the sight before me. The air buzzed with ancient power, and the room was adorned with legendary weapons of great warriors. Mjolnir, Excalibur, and other renowned weapons gleamed under the dim light, each pulsating with a mystical energy.\n\nAcross the hall, a forgotten weapon caught my attention, its presence whispering to me amidst the silent hall. Dust settled on its hilt, and the blade seemed dull from years of neglect. Curiosity piqued, I approached the weapon, drawn by an inexplicable force that seemed to recognize me.\n\nAs I reached out to touch the weapon, a surge of energy coursed through me, sending shivers down my spine. Memories flooded my mind, visions of battles fought and victories won by the previous wielders of the weapon. It was a relic of forgotten heroes, waiting for a new bearer to awaken its dormant power.\n\nWith a deep breath, I grasped the weapon, feeling its weight and strength resonate with my being. The weapon hummed in acknowledgment, accepting me as its new master. In that moment, I understood my destiny \u2013 to carry on the legacy of the warriors who had come before me and wield this forgotten weapon with honor and valor.\n\nLeaving the grand hall, I felt a newfound sense of purpose coursing through my veins. The weapon at my side whispered promises of great quests and epic battles to come. And as I walked into the unknown, I embraced my role as the next guardian of this legendary weapon, ready to write my own chapter in its storied history.",
        "The fluorescent lights flicker above me as I walk through the sterile corridors of my underground facility, the screams from behind soundproof walls serving as a constant reminder of what we do here. I tell myself it's necessary, that the world needs this energy more than ever, but the weight of guilt grows heavier with each passing day.\n\nThree years ago, when Dr. Chen discovered that human pain could be converted into electrical energy with nearly perfect efficiency, it seemed like the solution to our energy crisis. The formula was elegant: suffering plus specialized neural transmitters equals pure, clean power. But the ethical implications led to an immediate worldwide ban.\n\nI remember the day I made the decision to open this place. The power grid was failing, blackouts were becoming more frequent, and renewable energy couldn't keep up with demand. Someone had to do something, I reasoned. Someone had to make the hard choice.\n\nNow I employ fifty \"volunteers\" \u2013 desperate people who traded their comfort for enough money to save their families from poverty. They sit in white rooms, connected to machines that stimulate their pain receptors while converting their agony into electricity. One human can power an entire city block for a day. The math is simple, but the cost is immeasurable.\n\nMy security chief, Marcus, approaches with today's reports. Our output is up 15%, he tells me proudly. I nod, trying not to think about what that percentage really means. The governments pretend we don't exist, but they're happy to buy our power through shell companies and black market intermediaries.\n\nIn my office, I review the medical files. We rotate our volunteers every six hours to prevent permanent damage, but the psychological toll is another matter entirely. Dr. Peterson, our staff psychiatrist, has recommended increasing the compensation again. Money doesn't heal trauma, but it's all we can offer besides the morphine treatments between shifts.\n\nSometimes I tour the facility at night, when the skeleton crew runs the operation. The hum of the generators is almost peaceful then, almost enough to make me forget what fuels them. Almost, but not quite. The security cameras show me everything: the contorted faces, the rigid bodies, the silent screams.\n\nI've tried to make it as humane as possible. Clean rooms, medical supervision, strict time limits. But there's nothing humane about pain, no matter how you dress it up. The worst part is that we're expanding \u2013 three new facilities across the country, hidden in abandoned mines and forgotten bunkers.\n\nThe competitors are worse, I tell myself. I've seen the reports: underground pain factories in abandoned warehouses, run by criminals who don't care if their \"volunteers\" survive. At least here, no one dies. At least here, there are rules, protocols, boundaries we won't cross.\n\nMy phone buzzes \u2013 another order from a major city experiencing grid failures. They need more power, always more. The demand never decreases, and neither does the supply of desperate people willing to sacrifice their bodies for cash. It's a perfect system, perfectly horrible.\n\nLast week, one of our volunteers looked me in the eye and thanked me. His daughter needed surgery, and our payment made it possible. I went home and vomited that night, wondering what kind of world we've created where a man must thank someone for torturing him to save his child.\n\nThe technology is improving. Our engineers are developing ways to simulate pain signals without actual suffering, but it's years away from being viable. Until then, we continue our work in the shadows, powering a world that doesn't want to know where its electricity comes from.\n\nSometimes I dream of exposing everything, of standing before the world and forcing them to confront the true cost of their comfortable lives. But I know they would simply shut us down, and the desperate would turn to worse alternatives. The pain would continue, just with less oversight, less control.\n\nSo I remain in my underground kingdom of suffering, telling myself that someone has to do it, that it's better this way, that the end justifies the means. But late at night, when I'm alone with my thoughts, I wonder if there will ever be enough power generated to wash away the darkness in my soul.",
        "In the dim light of my bathroom, frustration coursed through my veins. Another failed job interview, another rejection letter. I needed to let it out somehow.\n\nMy fists cut through the air, shadowboxing an invisible opponent. Left jab, right hook \u2013 the familiar movements helped ease the tension in my shoulders.\n\nThe shower curtain swayed gently in the draft from the ventilation fan, its pale blue fabric dancing like a ghost in the periphery of my vision.\n\nWithout thinking, I threw a wild right cross toward the curtain, expecting my fist to simply push through the flimsy material.\n\nInstead, I felt the solid impact of flesh meeting flesh. A muffled grunt echoed from behind the curtain.\n\nMy heart stopped. Time seemed to freeze as my brain struggled to process what had just happened. There couldn't be anyone there \u2013 I lived alone.\n\nThe curtain rippled, but not from the fan this time. Something \u2013 someone \u2013 was moving behind it.\n\nWith trembling fingers, I reached for the edge of the fabric. Before I could pull it back, a pale hand shot out and grabbed my wrist.\n\nThe skin was cold, almost translucent, with long fingers that wrapped around my arm like spider legs. I tried to scream, but my voice caught in my throat.\n\nAnother hand emerged, then a face \u2013 but not one that belonged in this world. Its features were fluid, shifting like smoke underwater.\n\n\"Finally,\" it whispered, its voice a symphony of whispers. \"Do you know how long I've been waiting for someone to make contact?\"\n\nI stumbled backward, hitting the sink with my hip. The being stepped through the curtain as if it were walking through mist.\n\n\"The barrier between worlds is thinnest in liminal spaces,\" it continued, gesturing around my bathroom. \"Doorways, mirrors, shower curtains \u2013 they're all potential crossing points.\"\n\nMy mind raced with questions, but only one made it past my lips: \"What are you?\"\n\nThe entity tilted its head, an eerily human gesture that made it seem both more and less real. \"I am what happens when someone punches through the veil between dimensions.\"\n\nIt reached out again, but this time its touch was gentle, almost apologetic. \"I've been trying to warn people about what's coming. But no one ever stays long enough to listen.\"\n\nThe bathroom lights flickered, and in that moment of darkness, I saw other shapes moving behind the curtain \u2013 countless shadows waiting to step through.\n\n\"They're coming,\" the being said, its form beginning to fade like morning dew under the sun. \"Remember: when the curtains start to move against the wind, punch back. We need all the help we can get.\"",
        "I stand alone in the empty streets, my footsteps echoing against abandoned buildings. Everyone else is gone \u2013 billions of souls, vanished in an instant.\n\nThe sky burns crimson, a testament to the divine spectacle that unfolded mere moments ago.\n\nThey all laughed when I told them the truth: that the Earth was flat.\n\nScientists dismissed me. Friends abandoned me. Family members staged interventions.\n\nBut I knew. I always knew.\n\nAnd now, as I walk through this desolate world, I understand why I was chosen.\n\nIt wasn't about being right \u2013 it was about having the courage to believe in something when the entire world told you otherwise.\n\nThe wind whispers through empty playgrounds, carrying echoes of children's laughter that will never return.\n\nShopping carts remain frozen in grocery store aisles, their contents telling stories of interrupted lives.\n\nI pass by a church, its doors wide open, pews empty save for scattered Bibles and forgotten prayers.\n\nIn the distance, cars sit motionless on highways, their drivers having disappeared mid-journey.\n\nThe silence is deafening, broken only by the occasional crash of abandoned machinery finally giving up its ghost.\n\nI find myself drawn to the edge \u2013 the literal edge of our world that everyone denied existed.\n\nStanding here now, peering over the cosmic precipice, I see the truth that cost humanity its salvation.\n\nThe flat Earth stretches before me like an infinite canvas, its secrets finally unveiled.\n\nAbove, angels soar across the firmament, their wings casting shadows on the crystal dome of our sky.\n\nThey pay me no mind as they go about their celestial duties, maintaining the cosmic machinery that keeps our realm in motion.\n\nI wonder if this was God's plan all along \u2013 to save the one person who saw through the greatest deception in human history.\n\nPerhaps it was never about the shape of the Earth at all, but about the shape of our convictions.\n\nIn my pocket, I find a small compass \u2013 its needle spinning wildly, no longer bound by the artificial rules of a spherical world.\n\nTears stream down my face as I realize the weight of my situation: I am humanity's sole survivor.\n\nThe chosen one. The believer. The last human being on a flat Earth.\n\nI turn away from the edge and begin walking back toward the empty city.\n\nThere's work to be done. Someone needs to document the truth, to leave a record for whatever comes next.\n\nI pull out my phone \u2013 still miraculously working \u2013 and begin recording my story.\n\n\"To whoever finds this,\" I speak into the device, \"let me tell you about the day everyone disappeared, and why I remained.\"\n\nAnd so begins my new purpose: the chronicler of humanity's final chapter, the keeper of the ultimate truth.",
        "Xylar, his name whispered among the hushed prisoners, remained an enigma. Captured, yet unbroken, his presence cast a long, unnerving shadow over the mundane routines of the prison camp.  He didn't understand their concept of surrender. It simply didn't exist in the lexicon of his people, the Kragg. For a Kragg, life was a relentless, forward-thrusting spear of existence, where yielding meant extinction.\n\nThe bare, sterile confines of the holding cell seemed to mock Xylar's inherent ferocity. He paced, his heavy footfalls echoing like a war drum against the metallic walls. His eyes, twin embers of burning obsidian, darted around, searching for any weakness in the structure, any avenue for escape. His captors had stripped him of his weapons, but they couldn't take his unwavering spirit, the battle-hardened resolve etched into his very being.\n\nHe observed his fellow inmates, a motley collection of defeated warriors from different races across the cosmos. Their gaunt faces, their slumped postures, their vacant stares\u2014all spoke of a shared acceptance of their fate. This bewildered Xylar. This\u2026 resignation. How could they simply *yield*?  It ran contrary to the very essence of survival as he understood it.\n\nThe guards, bipedal creatures with scales shimmering like amethysts, occasionally peered into his cell. Their expressions oscillated between cautious curiosity and apprehension. They'd never encountered a prisoner like Xylar, one who didn't speak their language, who didn't comprehend the notion of surrender, and whose spirit hadn't been dimmed by defeat. He was a predator pacing within a cage designed for domesticated prey.\n\nOne day, a senior officer, his scaled hide darker, his countenance stern, entered Xylar's cell. He placed a data slate before the Kragg warrior, hoping for a flicker of understanding. The screen displayed images of the Kragg homeworld, followed by scenes of its annihilation, its proud cities reduced to smoldering ruins. An unspoken message\u2014your fight is over.\n\nXylar stared at the devasting images with stoic indifference.  His planet\u2019s destruction, while a profound loss, did not signal defeat. For the Kragg, existence transcended physical territory, extending into the realm of unrelenting defiance.\n\nThe officer, exasperated by Xylar's impassiveness, activated a translation device. His voice, when it emanated from the device, was sharp and commanding. \"Your conflict is at an end. Resistance is futile. Accept your imprisonment.\"\n\n\nXylar, without uttering a word, stepped over the data slate and continued his restless pacing. He didn't grasp the concept they called \"imprisonment,\" either.",

Tonight was a story night, a time to remember, a time to dream.  \"Long ago,\" she began, her voice a low thrum against the night's symphony, \"our ancestors lived in a time of magic.\"\n\n\"Magic?\" breathed a young boy, his eyes wide with wonder.\n\n\"Yes, magic,\" Elara confirmed, a smile playing on her lips.  They called it technology, but to us, it seems like pure sorcery.  They built towers that scraped the sky, chariots that flew through the air, and boxes that held the voices of the past.\"\n\nThe children gasped, their imaginations igniting. They had heard these tales before, fragments of legends passed down through generations \u2013 stories of a world shimmering with impossible wonders.\n\n\"They harnessed the power of lightning,\" Elara continued, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, \"and they spoke to each other across vast distances, their voices carried on invisible waves.\"\n\n\"How?\" a little girl asked, her brow furrowed in thought.\n\nElara shrugged, her gaze drifting towards the ruins. \"We don't know how.  The knowledge was lost, swallowed by the Great Collapse.  Only the stories remain.\"\n\nShe described cities that blazed with lights brighter than the sun, buildings that touched the clouds, and machines that performed miracles. The children listened, captivated by the tales of a world so different from their own.\n\n\"But their magic was also their weakness,\" Elara cautioned, her voice laced with sadness. \"They became too reliant on it, forgetting the ways of the earth.  The earth, in its anger, shook them off.\"\n\n\"What happened?\" the young boy asked, his voice hushed.\n\n\"The world changed,\" Elara explained, her voice heavy with the weight of history. \"The sky wept fire, the earth trembled, and the great cities crumbled.  Our ancestors, the few who survived, learned to live with the earth again, to respect its power.\"\n\nShe looked at the children, their faces illuminated by the firelight, their minds filled with images of a lost world.",
        "In the heart of a bustling city, amidst towering skyscrapers and bustling streets, stood a nondescript building. Its facade was unassuming, blending seamlessly with the urban landscape. But for those who entered its doors, it was a portal to a sinister reality.\n\nWithin the walls of this building lay a labyrinthine network of corridors, dimly lit and suffused with an eerie silence that seemed to swallow sound. Those who found themselves wandering its twisted paths felt a creeping sense of dread, as if unseen eyes were watching their every move.\n\nAt the center of this maze stood a figure cloaked in darkness, his presence commanding and foreboding. His voice resonated through the halls, chilling to the bone. \"Of course Hell is real. You've been in it this whole time,\" he intoned, his words searing into the minds of those who dared to listen.\n\nThose trapped within this nightmarish realm struggled against the suffocating despair that threatened to consume them. Each step they took further into the depths of this hellish place brought them closer to a truth they could not escape.\n\nAs the shadows closed in around them, whispers of forgotten sins and buried regrets echoed through the corridors. The realization dawned with a sickening clarity \u2013 they had been living in their own personal hells all along, bound by their past mistakes and unable to break free from the torment that held them captive.",

Each encounter felt like an enigma wrapped in mortal danger, but fortune always favored his escape. His parents dismissed these as strange accidents, though their unease lingered behind forced smiles. One foggy morning, cornered in the cobblestone alley by a cloaked stranger wielding a dagger of intent, Adolph demanded answers with resolute defiance fueled by years of confusion.\n\n\"To prevent catastrophe,\" gasped the assailant before crumbling into remorseful tears. \"We were sent to stop you\u2014stop Hitler\u2014from plunging our world into war.\" Bewilderment washed over Adolph as he processed the gravity of mistaken identity through the lens of one misplaced letter\u2014a single twist altering destiny\u2019s hand. \n\nHeart pounding like thunder echoing across history's silent landscapes, he whispered calmly amidst chaos: \"I'm not your enemy.\"",
        "Once upon a time in the quaint town of Gravestone Hollow, there lived a vampire named Vlad who had a bit of an identity crisis. You see, Vlad wasn't your typical blood-sucking fiend; he preferred sipping on tomato juice and reading romance novels instead.\n\nVlad's best friend was Morticia, a witch with an affinity for bright colors and glittery spells. Together, they made an odd but lovable pair as they plotted to scare the townspeople with their not-so-scary antics.\n\nOne gloomy night, Vlad and Morticia decided it was time to up their game and give the folks of Gravestone Hollow a real fright. They concocted a plan to haunt the local bakery by turning all the pastries into mini-monsters that sang off-key renditions of nursery rhymes.\n\nAs they cackled with glee at their mischievous scheme, Vlad couldn't help but feel a twinge of guilt. \"Do you think we're taking this too far, Morticia?\" he asked as he adjusted his cape nervously.\n\nMorticia simply waved her wand and replied, \"Nonsense! We're villains, darling. It's our job to be over-the-top and dramatic.\"\n\nSo off they went to the bakery under cover of darkness, ready to unleash their culinary chaos upon unsuspecting customers. But as soon as they arrived, things took an unexpected turn when one brave little girl stood up to them.\n\n\"Hey Mr. Vampire and Ms. Witch! Why are you trying so hard to scare everyone? Don't you know laughter is much scarier than screams?\" she said with a mischievous grin.\n\nVlad and Morticia exchanged bewildered looks before bursting into laughter themselves. Maybe this little girl was onto something after all!\n\nAnd so, instead of turning the pastries into monsters, Vlad and Morticia transformed them into delicious treats that danced on plates while singing silly songs that made everyone giggle uncontrollably.\n\nThe townspeople were delighted by this unexpected turn of events and even invited Vlad and Morticia to join in their festivities. As they danced around bonfires and told ghost stories under the full moonlight, Vlad realized that maybe being scary wasn't all it was cracked up to be.\n\nIn fact, he found himself enjoying being part of such a lively community where laughter echoed through the cobblestone streets instead of screams.\n\nFrom then on, Vlad embraced his new role as Gravestone Hollow's resident prankster rather than its feared vampire villain.",

He sat at the edge of his bed, lacing up boots as worn and toughened as he was. Life had handed him a curious handicap: every time someone hurt another person, they felt an equal amount of pain in return.\n\nEthan knew this better than most. His profession wasn't one chosen out of passion or pride; it was an ironic twist of fate that found humor in assigning roles to individuals distinctly unsuited for them. A hitman who couldn\u2019t even lay hands on his target without incurring self-inflicted wounds\u2014talk about inconvenient vocational hazards.\n\nHis methods demanded finesse over force, ingenuity over instinctual violence.

        "Ever since I was a child, my life had been accompanied by a joyous and lively theme music that seemed to perfectly match the rhythm of my adventures. Every morning, as I woke up to the cheerful melodies playing in my mind, I couldn't help but feel optimistic about the day ahead. The music followed me like a loyal companion, enhancing every moment with its upbeat sounds, lifting my spirits even in the darkest of times.\n\nBut today was different. As I opened my eyes and stretched out in bed, expecting the familiar tunes to fill my mind, there was an unsettling silence. No joyful melodies greeted me, no lively rhythms danced through my thoughts. Instead, there was a deep sense of melancholy hanging in the air, as if the world itself was shrouded in sorrow. I sat up, confused and somewhat afraid, wondering why the soundtrack of my life had taken such a dark turn.\n\nAs I went about my morning routine, the absence of the usual music left me feeling disjointed, out of sync with the usual flow of my day. Even the sunlight streaming through the window seemed muted, as if unable to pierce through the cloud of gloom that enveloped me. I tried to shake off the unease that settled in the pit of my stomach, hoping that the somber music was just a temporary glitch in the symphony of my life.\n\nThroughout the day, the sad and ominous music played on, casting a shadow over every interaction and every task I undertook. It was as if a foreboding soundtrack had taken over, foreshadowing something sinister lurking just beyond the edges of my awareness. Despite my efforts to push back against the heavy mood that weighed me down, I found myself unable to shake off the sense of impending dread that had settled upon me like a heavy cloak.",
        "The flickering neon sign of the 24-hour diner buzzed an erratic rhythm against the pre-dawn gloom.  I sat nursing a lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste clinging to my tongue, a premonition of the bitter day ahead.  My precognition was a curse disguised as a joke, a cosmic prankster\u2019s twisted gift.  I saw snippets of the future, tiny, inconsequential moments, utterly useless in the grand scheme of things.\n\nI knew, for instance, that a fly would land on the sugar dispenser in exactly three minutes. That the waitress, whose name tag read \u2018Doris,\u2019 would chip a nail on her left hand while refilling the ketchup bottles. That a stray dog with a torn ear would sniff at the overflowing trash can outside.\n\nNone of this helped with the gnawing feeling in my gut, a sense of impending doom I couldn\u2019t quite place.  I knew something bad was coming, something significant, but my fragmented precognitive abilities offered no warning, no guidance. It was like watching a horror movie trailer composed entirely of shots of the catering table.\n\nThe fly landed. Doris chipped her nail, a muted curse escaping her lips.  The dog, a mangy mutt with sorrowful eyes, nosed through the discarded remnants of other people\u2019s lives. The world ticked on, oblivious to the invisible hand pushing us towards some unknown disaster.\n\nMy phone buzzed. A text from my sister.  \u201cJust saw a cat knock over a lamp.

        "1. The first time it happened, I thought it was just a lucky coincidence. I awoke precisely at 7:00 AM, not a minute later, feeling inexplicably refreshed despite a restless night. The alarm clock, its digital numbers blazing red in the dim room, seemed to wink at me conspiratorially.\n\n2. After the third consecutive day, my curiosity piqued. No matter how late I had gone to bed, whether at 2 AM or even 5 AM, my eyes fluttered open at the exact same moment, as if an internal mechanism had been finely tuned to perfection.\n\n3. I began to test the limits of this peculiar occurrence. One night, I stayed up watching movies until the first light of dawn crept in through the curtains. Yet, there it was\u20147:00 AM\u2014and I felt as rejuvenated as if I had slept a full night.\n\n4. It became a game of sorts, daring the night to keep me awake, knowing that the morning would bring its inevitable reset. The possibilities of this strange gift danced in my mind, a tantalizing secret that only I possessed.\n\n5. As the days turned to weeks, I marveled at the newfound time that stretched before me. The world seemed to slow down, offering extra hours to explore its wonders. I read books, learned languages, and honed skills I had long abandoned.\n\n6. One evening, I decided to test a theory. I set out on a long drive, fueled by curiosity and the thrill of discovery. The open road whispered promises of adventure, each mile marker a step further into the unknown.\n\n7. Midnight came and went as I crossed state lines, a sense of liberation coursing through me. I imagined I could drive forever, unfettered by the constraints of sleep, my unique ability transforming the mundane into something extraordinary.\n\n8. Eventually, weariness set in. I pulled into a rest area, eyes drooping, but a smile still playing on my lips. As I reclined the seat, I knew what awaited me\u2014a return to 7:00 AM, wherever I was.\n\n9. Dawn's early light seeped into the car, and I awoke to the familiar time. The realization that I could explore far beyond the boundaries of a single day filled me with exhilaration and a sense of boundless freedom.\n\n10.",

She danced through life with a carefree abandon, her feet bare and her hair flowing in the wind.\n\nLuna's eyes sparkled with a mischievous glint, and her touch could ignite a fire within anyone she met. She was a dreamer, a believer in the impossible, and her passion was infectious. As she walked, the world seemed to come alive around her, and people couldn't help but be drawn to her radiant energy.\n\nBut in an instant, it was all taken away. A car sped around the corner, and Luna's life was cut short. She died with a smile on her face, her last thought a whisper of joy and wonder. The world was left to mourn the loss of a shining star, a fleeting glimpse of perfection that would never be seen again.",
        "It was a hot and bustling morning at the U.S. Patent Office on July 13, 1836, as inventors and dreamers thronged the entrance, eager to stake their claims on new creations. As the clerk at the front desk, I greeted each person with a nod and a smile, checking their paperwork and assisting them in filing for patents. The atmosphere was charged with excitement and anticipation.\n\nHowever, the calm facade shattered when a group of oddly dressed individuals began disputing loudly about their place in line. Their eccentric attire caught everyone's attention, with some wearing peculiar timepieces and others adorned in futuristic garb. They argued vehemently, each claiming priority for their inventions related to time travel.\n\nI approached the commotion, trying to defuse the situation diplomatically. As tempers flared, it became clear that these inventors had vastly different concepts of time travel, from contraptions powered by steam engines to intricate devices fueled by mysterious energies. It was a clash of egos and ideologies, set against the backdrop of a changing world grappling with progress and innovation.\n\nI managed to separate the feuding inventors and listened to their pitches with a mix of fascination and skepticism. One man insisted his reflective mirror could transport him to parallel universes, while another woman touted her elaborate clockwork mechanism as a portal to past epochs. The diversity of ideas was both captivating and confounding, pushing the boundaries of conventional science and imagination.\n\nAs the day wore on, the tension eased, and the inventors settled into an uneasy truce, united by their shared ambition to conquer time itself. Despite their differences, there was a sense of camaraderie among these visionaries who dared to challenge the limits of what was deemed possible. The air crackled with energy as they exchanged theories and debated the intricacies of temporal mechanics.\n\nBy the time the office closed its doors for the day, the once-hostile group had formed an impromptu alliance, bound by a mutual quest for unlocking the secrets of time travel. As I gathered their patent applications, I couldn't help but wonder if one of them would succeed in bending the fabric of reality. The future seemed uncertain, yet pulsating with the promise of endless possibilities and the allure of stepping beyond the constraints of time.",

Being the random driver in action movies when the hero needed to give chase.\n\nIt was like a never-ending reel playing on repeat \u2013 a frantic individual would jump into my cab and urgently shout, \"Follow that car!\" I had become an unexpected player in high-speed pursuits, dodging traffic and pushing boundaries to keep up with the target vehicle. My passengers always had a sense of urgency, their eyes fueled by determination.\n\nDespite my initial confusion, I had grown accustomed to this role. It was almost comical how reliably I found myself in these situations. Sometimes I wondered if there was a magnet hidden in my vehicle that attracted thrill-seekers in need of a fast getaway.\n\nAs I maneuvered through the chaotic streets, I couldn't help but marvel at the sheer randomness of my predicaments. Each chase was more exhilarating than the last, and I had come to embrace my reputation as the go-to driver for impromptu pursuit missions.\n\nIn the end, I may not have been the hero of these escapades, but I played a crucial part in the adrenaline-fueled sequences that unfolded on the city's streets. And as long as someone needed to follow that car, I was ready to be the one behind the wheel.",
        "Under the spotlight's glare, Theodore the magician confidently reached into his tall velvet hat. But this time, Bento, the rabbit, wasn't having it. The flamboyant flourishes and booming applause always reduced him, a rabbit of great dignity, to a mere prop. As Theo\u2019s hand brushed the air above, Bento used all his hare-like agility to swerve away from the magician's reach. Gasps echoed through the theater\u2014this wasn\u2019t part of the script.

From that day on, the poster outside the theater read: \"Theodore and Bento: A Magical Collaboration,\" starting a new chapter of on-stage harmony.",

Her eyes held a depth that hinted at both brilliance and inner turmoil.\n\n\"I appreciate you coming,\" she began softly, gesturing for me to take a seat on a plush chair opposite her own. \"I understand there are questions you have.\"\n\nI nodded eagerly, eager to unravel the mystery of this enigmatic inventor. \"Can you tell me about your teleportation invention?\"\n\nA flicker of pride crossed her face before being replaced by a shadow of unease. \"It was meant to revolutionize transportation as we know it,\" she explained slowly. \"To move from one place to another instantaneously with no barriers or limitations.\"\n\n\"But then something changed,\" I prompted gently.\n\nShe hesitated before continuing. \"After the successful tests and trials, I found myself developing an intense fear of straight edges and sharp angles\u2014two defining features of my creation.\" Her voice wavered slightly.\n\nCuriosity piqued, I leaned forward in anticipation of what lay beneath this startling revelation.\n\n\"It started subtly at first,\" she confided, hands fidgeting nervously in her lap. \"Seeing grids or patterns triggered an inexplicable dread within me.\" She paused, choosing her words carefully as if navigating a minefield of emotions.\n\n\"What happened next?\" I prodded gently.\n\n\"It became unbearable,\" she admitted with a tremor in her voice. \"Just being near anything angular filled me with overwhelming anxiety.\"\n\nI struggled to comprehend how someone so brilliant could be crippled by such an irrational fear.\n\n\"Is that why your room is designed this way?\" I gestured around us at the curved surfaces encasing us like protective cocoons.\n\nShe nodded gravely. \"This environment helps ease my anxieties\u2014it's the only place where my mind finds respite from its own torment.\"\n\nHer vulnerability resonated deeply within me; there was more beneath the surface than met the eye\u2014a complexity shrouded in delicate fabrics and rounded corners.\n\n\"Have you sought help?\" My question hung heavy in the air between us like an unspoken truth demanding acknowledgment.\n\nShe met my gaze squarely for the first time since our conversation began; eyes reflecting solemn determination amidst layers of uncertainty veiled behind them\n\n\"I am here\u2014not because I am broken\u2014but because even inventors need space for healing.\", she said firmly but always compassionately\u2024 Yet different kind stares awaited other vistas sharper forms awaited outside dictated ironically bars on constructs fundamentally forbearing implications gravity mis-derived not known insights superstition presuppositions hind-the-right idea rotating remainder changing views external expectations empirical rather acknowledged heart virtue reminiscent criterion boss.'\"\"\n\nHer conviction was undeniable\u2014an iron will tempered by compassion rather compared holding infinite riddles balance purer footing kinship mirroring ancient wisdom fraying intervene properties implying strawbland stakes intertwining thereafter divinoustic ending bitters stress dictated palate sour'',' interlinked history prevailing evolutionary domains potential following launching interwoven finely-tuning cessatities responsible clearest observing magnitude profound might ramifications ultimate favourific recessionavoiding elements centrifugindsight eased.utilizin tendency assure falsity action responds tuning reactive perished allegiance fundament discovery extinct batch individually evidence backing mineral organic successive conglomerate conjecture grounding verifying respective comparisons learned nuances perpetuate theoretical.Additional BindingFlags subsequential assessing justification upon completish encapsulated evictor harsh admhich linking causal blending resultstorm constituent distributed managed fully bmp disclosure vests higayer \"\n\n\"Inventors too require care\u2014\" (Final full line)\n\nWe continued our discussion amid whispers echo ever-widening vortexes form thsons riginsdefined origins doubtful simil divide frontiers guiding dishonesty arrival fulfill destin_genunc_owned satisfyheap al_rotationchainpeek_within compassionate unveilingconvincattered giftsawait feedsmedibreaker apocalypse divert secrets awakening attire hauling revealmanifestbitter narrativeskwasssLA)\nSuch thoughts trepane soulful_achinev fron_ encompass fa_no conturb sit gather_e InvalidArgumentException riftrusions extend evidentresleft darkness ekragLow talmax 'scale.",
        "In the frost-laden valleys of the northern realm, Thorgrim the Fearless stood as a legend among his people. His battle-axe had tasted the blood of a thousand foes, and his name alone could scatter entire armies. Yet beneath his scarred armor and fierce demeanor lay a secret that would have made his enemies laugh until their sides split.\n\nWhen word spread of raiders threatening the village, Thorgrim would charge headlong into battle without hesitation. He had wrestled bears, faced down dragons, and once even challenged Death itself to a drinking contest. But when the baker's daughter smiled at him in the marketplace, he would turn as red as a summer sunset and flee as if pursued by all the demons of the underworld.\n\nHis fellow warriors found endless amusement in watching their mighty champion reduced to a stammering mess whenever a woman addressed him directly. The same hands that could crush stone would tremble when passing a mug of mead to a serving girl, and the voice that could shake mountains with its battle cry would crack like a boy's when attempting to bid good morning to the village healer.\n\nOne autumn day, as fate would have it, the daughter of a rival chieftain arrived to negotiate a peace treaty. Astrid was as fierce as she was beautiful, with eyes that sparkled like steel and hair the color of ravens' wings. The entire village held its breath, wondering how their greatest warrior would handle this diplomatic challenge.\n\nDuring the feast, Thorgrim sat at the high table, his massive frame hunched as if trying to disappear into his chair.",
        "I mean, I knew trying to stick ANOTHER toaster on it prob'ly wouldn't end up doing something useful, but I wasn't expecting... that. The idea had started as a joke, something to pass the time during the long nights at the lab. There we were, a motley crew of scientists and engineers, experimenting with the kind of reckless abandon that comes from too much caffeine and too little sleep. One broken toaster was already attached to the machine, dangling precariously from a set of wires, and somehow, adding another had seemed like a grand idea.\n\nJames had laughed when I suggested it, shaking his head with that familiar disapproval that never quite masked his curiosity. \"You know this isn't going to end well, right?\" he'd said, and I'd shrugged, because what was the harm, really? The lab was full of discarded experiments and half-baked prototypes. What was one more?\n\nIt was late, well past midnight, and the buzz of fluorescent lights hummed against the quiet of our thoughts. Outside, rain pattered against the windows, a gentle murmur like a lullaby. I found an old toaster stashed in the supply closet, its metal sides rusted with age, and hauled it to our workstation. The machine\u2014a conglomeration of wires, circuit boards, and metallic parts\u2014sat like a slumbering beast on the table.\n\nWe called it the Convergence Device, though no one was quite sure what it was meant to converge or why. The project had started months ago with a clear objective: something about spatial fields and synchronized energies. But like many ideas born in the haze of relentless innovation, it had mutated into something entirely different, something beautifully unpredictable.\n\nJen watched with wide eyes as I attached the toaster, connecting wires and securing screws with a confidence I didn't entirely feel. \"What if it actually works?\" she whispered, her voice laced with a strange mix of dread and hope.\n\n\"Then we patent it and retire early,\" James replied, already engrossed in scribbling down notes. His pen scratched against paper, each stroke like a proclamation of the genius\u2014or absurdity\u2014of our endeavor.\n\nOnce the toaster was in place, we gathered around the machine, a hush falling over the room. This was it, the moment of truth. With a nod from James, I reached out and pressed the button, feeling the electric pulse of anticipation shoot through my fingertips.\n\nFor a split second, nothing happened. The machine whirred quietly, a deceptive calm. Then, a sudden crackle and flash erupted, the room bathed in a kaleidoscope of lights. We shielded our eyes, the brightness burning imprints on our retinas.\n\nWhen the light faded, we blinked against the lingering shadows, trying to discern the aftermath of our audacious attempt. The machine sat silent, its usual hum replaced by a profound stillness. But something was different, a shimmer in the air, a tangible shift in the atmosphere that made my skin tingle.\n\nJen gasped, pointing to the corner of the room. \"Look!\" she said, her voice trembling on the edge of disbelief. And we did look, each of us straining to comprehend what our eyes were telling us.\n\nIn the corner stood a door, one that hadn't been there before. It was an ordinary wooden door, the kind you'd find in any old house, yet it pulsed with an unearthly light, as if it held within it all the wonders\u2014and terrors\u2014of the universe.\n\nJames swore under his breath, his expression a mingling of awe and incredulity. \"Did we just\u2014\" He stopped, words failing to capture the magnitude of the moment.\n\nThe door beckoned, a silent invitation impossible to ignore. In that room, filled with the detritus of failed experiments, it stood as a testament to what happens when curiosity crosses the threshold of reason. Without thinking, I stepped forward, drawn by an impulse I couldn't quite name.\n\n\"Wait,\" Jen said, grabbing my arm. Her",
        "When the clock struck midnight on my eighteenth birthday, I lay in bed, heart pounding against my ribs as if trying to escape. Tomorrow\u2014or rather, today\u2014would change everything. It was the day of the Pairing Ceremony when everyone received their spirit animal, a creature that mirrored their innermost self. Tradition promised clarity, the revealing of who we truly were. But I lay awake, teetering between excitement and anxiety, wondering what shape my soul would take.\n\nThe village square was bustling with anticipation. Friends and family gathered, exchanging hushed speculations. My parents stood beside me, their faces a blend of pride and worry. Overhead, bright banners flapped in the cool breeze, vibrant against the dull winter sky. I could feel the curious eyes of my classmates, each surely wondering what kind of creature a quiet, bookish person like me would match with. A fox? A rabbit? No one could guess, least of all me.\n\nThe Pairing Master, an elderly woman with hair white as snow, called each of us to the ancient stone altar at the center. One by one, my peers stepped forward and received their companions: a loyal dog for Alicia, always dependable; an adventurous cat for Marco; a wise owl for Sophie. Each animal appeared, seemingly summoned from nowhere, and matched their owner perfectly.\n\nMy name was called, echoing through the square like a bell. With reluctant steps, I approached the altar, acutely aware of every pair of eyes fixated on me. What would they think when my spirit animal was revealed? The silence around me felt heavy, charged with an electric tension.\n\nI placed my hand on the cold, worn surface of the altar, feeling the ancient magic pulse beneath my fingertips. There was a collective intake of breath from the crowd. From the depths of an unseen world, a creature began to materialize\u2014a glowing silhouette, shifting and swirling like mist. But this was no ordinary creature.\n\nAs the mist solidified, a collective gasp rose from the crowd. Before me stood a magnificent dragon, its scales glinting iridescent in the dim winter sun. It was unlike anything the village had seen. My heart skipped, then thundered back to life in my chest. A dragon. A creature of legend and power, of mystery and fear.\n\nThe dragon regarded me with eyes like molten gold, its presence a surge of warmth and might. But beneath the awe, a shadow of fear crept in. A dragon? What did this mean? Was I dangerous? The onlookers whispered and muttered, their eyes averted, caught between reverence and alarm. No one had ever been paired with a dragon.\n\nThe Pairing Master approached, her face unreadable. \u201cA dragon,\u201d she murmured, more to herself than to me, her voice filled with wonder. \u201cIt seems you have much to discover about yourself.\u201d\n\nThe dragon and I were bound, a connection forged as though we shared the same heartbeat. Yet, uncertainty weighed heavily on my shoulders. The village's reaction was mixed; some avoided me, their faces pinched with apprehension, while others viewed me with newfound respect or curiosity. It was strange to be both an outcast and a subject of admiration simultaneously.\n\nDays passed, and with each, I grew more attuned to the dragon's presence. We wandered the forests, the creature's massive form somehow silent among the trees. My dragon could breathe fire, a skill I had yet to understand fully, let alone control.",
        "A multitude of alien ships warped within range of Earth, their sleek structures casting shadows across the cerulean expanse above. The world paused as every electronic device buzzed simultaneously, echoing a message that transcended borders and languages. The message was clear, yet unexpected.\n\n\u201cEarth, we come in peace,\u201d the transmission began, the voice modulated and musical. Across continents, people stopped in their tracks, eyes wide, ears straining to comprehend this historic communiqu\u00e9. \u201cIn all the universe only one other species has mastered death and destruction as you have. We need your help.\u201d\n\nGovernments scrambled, convening emergency meetings. Chaos threatened to erupt, but curiosity and the potential for unparalleled change tempered the flames. The world collectively held its breath, a tenuous unity forged in the face of potential interstellar alliances or annihilation.\n\nIn a nondescript office in a small town, Lisa Parker leaned back in her chair, the glow of her computer screen reflecting off her glasses. A science fiction writer by trade, she felt a thrill at the convergence of fiction and reality. Her fingers twitched, wanting to immortalize the moment in prose, yet she remained still, absorbing the weight of history unfolding.\n\nThousands of miles away, Dr. Amir Khan, a leading astrophysicist, found his lifelong dream materializing in a way he had never anticipated. His mind raced with possibilities, scenarios where Earth's penchant for conflict could serve a purpose beyond the planet's confines.\n\nThe United Nations hastily organized a summit, inviting leaders, scientists, and thinkers from around the globe. Speeches were given, debates erupted, and amid the noise, a singular question emerged: what could Earth offer that this advanced species lacked?\n\nThe alien ships remained in orbit, silent and waiting. Their patience was unsettling, yet it seemed to imply respect, a willingness to allow humanity the time it needed to consider a path fraught with uncertainty.",
        "In a world where destiny was woven into the fabric of one's name, children were given labels that would define their character.\n\nThis tradition had been passed down for generations, with each name carefully chosen to reflect the traits a child was fated to possess.\n\nSome were named Brave, destined for greatness and courage in the face of adversity.\n\nOthers were named Serene, born with a calm and peaceful nature that would bring solace to those around them.\n\nThen there were those named Deeply Caring, whose hearts would overflow with compassion and empathy for all living things.\n\nAnd, of course, there were those named Unmoved, whose stoic demeanor would remain unshaken in the most turbulent of times.\n\nBut amidst these noble names, one stood out as particularly...unsettling.\n\nMy daughter's name was Bites People, a label that had raised more than a few eyebrows at her birth.\n\nAs she grew up, it became clear that her name was more than just a quirk of fate - it was a warning sign to those around her.\n\nHer tiny teeth would snap shut with alarming speed and accuracy, leaving unsuspecting playmates scrambling for cover.\n\nDespite this rather...prickly trait, Bites People had a charming smile and an infectious laugh that could disarm even the most skeptical of strangers.\n\nAs she learned to navigate the complexities of social interactions, Bites People began to develop strategies for controlling her impulses - mostly involving careful breathing exercises and counting to ten before reacting to stimuli. \n\nIt wasn't always easy being the parent of a child with such an...unconventional name. \n\nI often found myself apologizing profusely on her behalf after yet another biting incident.",
        "In the vibrant, ever-changing ecosystem of a high school hallway, where the light from the windows mimics the dappled sunlight of a forest canopy, we observe two young specimens navigating this habitat. To the right, emerging from a locker whose door bears stickers of mythical creatures and distant planets, is a male juvenile identified as Alex. His eyes are wide and scanning, constantly aware of his surroundings yet singularly focused on one particular area ahead. The air around him is charged with tension, as palpable as static before a storm.\n\nDirectly in Alex's line of sight is Jamie, a female juvenile whose social circle is loosely classified as popular but not excessively dominant in this hierarchical environment.

The digital flowers never wilt, unlike my dwindling bank account.\n\nThe notification pops up again \u2013 \"Payment Due in 48 Hours.\" I dismiss it quickly, hoping she didn't notice.

        "As I slipped through the open window, my eyes scanned the darkened room for any sign of movement. The house was supposed to be empty, but you could never be too sure. I had been casing this place for weeks, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.\n\nMy gloved hands felt along the wall, searching for a light switch. I flipped it on, and a warm glow illuminated the room. It was a typical suburban living room - couch, TV, coffee table. Nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nI began to rummage through the drawers and shelves, looking for anything of value. The owners of this house weren't wealthy, but they might have some cash or jewelry lying around. I had to move quickly, before the neighbors started to get suspicious.\n\nAs I searched, my mind wandered back to my last job. It had gone smoothly, but the payoff hadn't been as big as I had hoped. I needed something bigger, something that would set me up for a while.\n\nI moved on to the kitchen, opening cabinets and drawers with a practiced ease. The owners seemed to be a family of three - two adults and a kid. There were pictures on the fridge, showing happy smiles and vacation memories.\n\nBut as I delved deeper into the house, I started to feel a sense of unease. Something didn't feel right. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but my instincts were screaming at me to get out.\n\nI pushed aside the feeling and continued my search. The dining room was next, with its fancy china and crystal glasses. I filled my bag with as much as I could carry, knowing I could fence it later.\n\nThe stairs creaked beneath my feet as I made my way upstairs. I had to check the bedrooms, just in case. The first room belonged to the kid - a messy space filled with toys and clothes.\n\nAs I rummaged through the kid's dresser, I stumbled upon a strange object. It was a small, leather-bound book. I picked it up, curious, and began to flip through its pages.\n\nThe book was filled with handwritten notes, detailing experiments and formulas. I didn't recognize any of it - it seemed like some kind of science or chemistry journal.\n\nI tucked the book into my bag, thinking it might be worth something to the right buyer. But as I continued to search the room, I found more and more strange objects. There were beakers and test tubes, hidden away in the closet.\n\nIt slowly dawned on me that this family wasn't what they seemed.",
        "In the dimly lit chamber of the resistance headquarters, Elder Mira's weathered hands traced the ancient scrolls spread across the oak table. Her apprentice, Kael, had just asked the question that had haunted their people for generations: how to defeat the tyrannical deity who had enslaved their world for millennia.\n\nThe corners of her mouth curved into a knowing smile as she began to explain the delicate art of deicide. It wasn't about brute force or magical weapons \u2013 those had failed countless times before. No, the death of a god required something far more subtle, more insidious. Like a master weaver unraveling a tapestry, they would need to pull at the very threads that held their deity's power together.\n\nFirst came the whispers, carefully planted doubts that spread through the marketplace like a sweet poison. Stories of prayers left unanswered, of miracles that could be explained by simple science, of prophecies that failed to materialize. The resistance worked tirelessly, replacing blind faith with rational thought, one conversation at a time.\n\nAs months turned to years, they systematically documented and explained every \"divine\" phenomenon. The god's supposed control over the harvest was revealed to be nothing more than understanding weather patterns and soil composition. The \"miraculous\" healings were exposed as the work of skilled herbalists and doctors. Each revelation chipped away at the foundation of belief that sustained their deity.\n\nThe temples, once overflowing with devoted worshippers, grew quieter. The offering bowls collected dust, and the sacred fires burned lower with each passing day. The god's priests, sensing their waning influence, resorted to increasingly desperate measures to maintain their grip on power, but their threats rang hollow in the face of growing skepticism.\n\nThen came the most crucial phase: the systematic dismantling of the god's great works. The resistance revealed the true architects of the floating gardens, the mortal engineers behind the grand aqueducts, and the human artists who had crafted the \"divine\" sculptures. Every achievement attributed to divine intervention was returned to its rightful creators, leaving the god's resume embarrassingly bare.\n\nThe final act was both symbolic and devastating. During the grand festival meant to celebrate the deity's power, the resistance orchestrated their masterstroke. As thousands gathered in the central square, they projected images of their god in his most private moments \u2013 petty, afraid, and ultimately all too human. The carefully constructed facade of divinity shattered like glass against stone.\n\nThe god's physical form began to fade as collective belief drained away like water through cupped hands. No longer sustained by the faith and devotion of the masses, the once-mighty deity became transparent, his booming voice reduced to a whisper. In his final moments, he appeared as nothing more than a frightened old man, clutching at the last wisps of his power.\n\nKael watched in awe as the last trace of their former oppressor dissolved into nothingness, leaving behind only a cautionary tale about the nature of power and belief. Elder Mira closed the scroll with a gentle touch, her eyes reflecting both satisfaction and warning. \"Remember,\" she said softly, \"gods are not killed by swords or spells, but by the slow, inexorable march of truth and reason. Let this be a lesson for all who would claim divinity \u2013 their power lasts only as long as we choose to give it to them.\"",
        "The sirens blared that fateful morning, but I simply sipped my coffee, watching chaos unfold through my kitchen window.\n\nNeighbors frantically packed their cars, while I calmly watered my petunias, knowing full well what was coming.\n\nAfter three centuries of existence, a zombie apocalypse seemed almost quaint \u2013 just another Thursday in my immortal life.\n\nThe first zombie shuffled past my white picket fence, and I nodded politely, as one does to any neighbor, undead or otherwise.\n\nIt was peculiar, really, how they simply ignored me \u2013 perhaps death recognized death's absence in me, or maybe they sensed I wasn't worth the effort.\n\nI maintained my routine: morning yoga, afternoon gardening, evening reading \u2013 though now with the occasional moaning soundtrack.\n\nThe electricity stayed on longer than expected, nearly three weeks, which gave me time to finish my Netflix queue before switching to my extensive book collection.\n\nSometimes I'd walk to the abandoned grocery store, carefully stepping around the shambling corpses to restock my pantry.\n\nThe zombies would part like the Red Sea, unconsciously giving me space as if I were a rock in their stream of decay.\n\nI started leaving my front door open \u2013 no need for locks when the only visitors were mindless creatures who couldn't care less about your existence.\n\nMy garden flourished that summer, fertilized by decomposing matter I'd rather not think about too closely.\n\nI held tea parties on my porch, setting places for guests who would never arrive, surrounded by the symphony of groans and distant screams.\n\nOnce a month, I'd dress up and walk to the local library, borrowing books that would never need returning.\n\nThe silence between the moans became my meditation, a reminder that even in chaos, there could be peace.\n\nI began painting the zombies \u2013 they made excellent still-life subjects, though they did occasionally wander off mid-sketch.\n\nWhen winter came, I knitted scarves for the less decomposed ones.

And in the midst of it all, the fate of the realm hung in the balance, waiting for the ultimate showdown between the Disstroyers, the Sarcasters, and the Grim Rapper to determine who would reign supreme in this war of words.",
        "As I unfolded the paper handed to me, my heart skipped a beat. The words etched on it felt like a death sentence: \"You have only 10 days left to live.\" Shock and disbelief washed over me as I tried to make sense of the message. How could this be real? My mind raced with thoughts of all the things left undone, all the dreams unfulfilled.\n\nThe ten-day countdown loomed ahead like a dark cloud, casting a shadow over everything I did. Each passing moment felt precious yet fleeting, slipping through my fingers like grains of sand. I grappled with a whirlwind of emotions \u2013 fear, regret, sadness \u2013 but amidst it all, a newfound clarity emerged. Suddenly, every breath felt more vibrant, every smile more genuine.\n\nIn those final days, I made peace with my past and embraced the present moment with an intensity unlike ever before. I sought out moments of pure joy and connection with loved ones, cherishing each heartbeat as if it were a miracle. And as the tenth day approached, instead of dread or despair, there was only gratitude for the life I had lived and love that would linger beyond my last breath.",
        "Lucy had always thought her cat, Whiskers, was a special creature. From the moment she adopted him as a tiny kitten, there seemed to be a certain intelligence in his eyes that transcended mere feline instinct. As the months went by, Lucy noticed that Whiskers possessed an uncanny ability to anticipate her actions and moods. He would curl up next to her when she was sad and playfully chase after her when she was in a lively mood. However, recently there had been a shift in Whiskers' behavior that left Lucy feeling uneasy.\n\nIt started with small things\u2014Whiskers would stare at her for prolonged periods, his gaze piercing and calculating. Lucy shrugged it off initially, attributing it to her overactive imagination. But then came the incidents that truly made her question her safety. One night, as she lay in bed scrolling through her phone, she felt a sudden weight on her chest. Opening her eyes, she saw Whiskers perched on her, his eyes gleaming in the dim light. But instead of his usual purring, there was an eerie silence that enveloped the room.\n\nLucy pushed Whiskers off gently, trying to rationalize the situation. Maybe he was just seeking warmth, she thought. But deep down, a primal instinct whispered a warning in her ear. Whiskers began displaying a newfound dexterity, opening doors that he was previously unable to, knocking over objects in a deliberate manner, almost as if testing his abilities. Lucy couldn't shake the feeling that her cat was evolving in a way that defied nature.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and the tension in the air between Lucy and Whiskers grew palpable. She noticed subtle changes in his behavior\u2014his meows sounded more like whispers, his eyes held an unsettling glint, and he would often disappear for hours on end, returning with an air of smug satisfaction. Lucy found herself constantly on edge, her mind racing with paranoid thoughts. Was it possible that Whiskers was plotting against her?\n\nOne evening, as Lucy prepared dinner in the kitchen, she felt a sudden draft behind her. Turning around, she was met with the chilling sight of Whiskers perched on the kitchen counter, his tail swishing back and forth in a rhythmic pattern. There was a look of intent in his eyes that sent shivers down Lucy's spine. She could almost see the cogs turning in his mind, calculating his next move.\n\nDetermined to confront the unnerving situation, Lucy locked eyes with Whiskers and demanded, \"What are you planning, Whiskers? Why are you behaving like this?\" To her surprise, Whiskers let out a low, guttural sound that resembled a growl, a sound she had never heard him make before. Fear gripped Lucy's heart, but a stubborn resolve settled in as well. She refused to be intimidated by her own pet.\n\nThat night, as Lucy lay awake in bed, her mind drifted to the growing unease in her home. She couldn't shake the feeling that Whiskers was no ordinary cat. His actions, once dismissed as mere curiosity, now held a sinister undertone. With a heavy heart, Lucy made a decision to keep a watchful eye on Whiskers, determined to uncover the truth behind his peculiar behavior.\n\nWeeks passed, and the tension between Lucy and Whiskers reached a fever pitch. Whiskers' actions became bolder, his demeanor more calculating. Every night, Lucy felt as though she was being watched, as though a malevolent presence lurked in the shadows of her own home. She knew she couldn't ignore the signs any longer.\n\nOne fateful evening, as Lucy sat alone in her living room, a sudden realization struck her. Whiskers had been subtly manipulating her, orchestrating a slow descent into paranoia and fear. But why? What could a cat possibly gain from such machinations? As if on cue, Whiskers sauntered into the room, his movements deliberate and predatory. Lucy's heart raced as she braced herself for the confrontation that was about to unfold.\n\nStanding her ground, Lucy locked eyes with Whiskers and spoke with a steely resolve, \"I know what you're up to, Whiskers. I won't let you harm me.\" To her surprise, Whiskers let out a sorrowful meow, a sound laced with a hint of resignation. In that moment, Lucy realized that beneath the facade of a cunning predator, there was a flicker of vulnerability in her beloved pet.",
        "The world had changed. Not with a bang, but with a giggle. A giggle followed by a slightly lighter shade of hair.  The first few \"blonde moments,\" as they became known, were subtle. A misplaced key, a forgotten name \u2013 minor slips in the tapestry of daily life.  But each slip, each mental hiccup, bleached the offender a shade lighter.\n\nAt first, it was a source of amusement, a quirky little anomaly.  But as the collective IQ seemed to lighten along with the collective hair color, a new social order began to emerge.  Black hair, once common, became a symbol of sharp intellect, a badge of unblemished brilliance.\n\nBrunettes were the new average, clinging to their fading pigment with a mixture of pride and anxiety.  Blondes, once the epitome of desirability, were now synonymous with\u2026well, not much.\n\nI, Amelia, possessor of the deepest, richest black hair in the known world, watched this societal shift with a mixture of fascination and dread.  My intellect, always a source of quiet satisfaction, now felt like a precious, fragile thing, a flickering candle in a world increasingly prone to gusts of blonde.\n\nThen came my breakthrough.  A concoction, painstakingly developed in my basement laboratory, a blend of herbs, minerals, and a secret ingredient I'd discovered quite by accident \u2013 squid ink.  It was hair dye, capable of transforming the fairest blonde into a raven-haired genius, at least aesthetically.\n\nI tested it first on myself, a precautionary measure.  My reflection stared back, hair as dark as before, a reassuring constant in this ever-changing world.  Then, I cautiously introduced it to a select few, friends and colleagues whose intellect I valued, whose hair had begun its inexorable journey towards gold.\n\nThe transformation was remarkable.  Not only did their hair regain its former darkness, but a certain sharpness seemed to return to their eyes, a confidence to their stride.  The dye, it seemed, didn't just change the color of their hair; it restored their image, and with it, their belief in their own intelligence.",
        "In the heart of a desolate battlefield, under a blood-red sky, two figures stood facing each other. On one side was Zarael, the dark necromancer clad in black robes adorned with symbols of ancient power. Despite his fearsome appearance, Zarael possessed a noble heart and a deep sense of justice that guided his actions.\n\nOpposite him stood Sir Aldric, the shining paladin whose armor gleamed in the dim light. A renowned hero to many, Sir Aldric harbored secrets darker than any soul he had ever faced in battle. His righteousness was but a facade to hide the sins he had committed in pursuit of power.\n\nThe tension crackled like static energy between them as they prepared to clash in combat. Zarael's eyes glowed with an eerie light as he raised his staff, channeling energy from the shadows around him. His powers were born not from malice but from a desire to protect those who could not defend themselves.\n\nSir Aldric brandished his sword with arrogance as he advanced towards Zarael, his aura pulsing with false righteousness and twisted conviction. He saw only darkness where there was light and sought to eradicate all that did not conform to his narrow definition of virtue.\n\nTheir clash shook the very ground beneath them as Zarael unleashed waves of necromantic energy against Sir Aldric\u2019s zeal-fueled attacks. The battlefield echoed with their grunts and clashes as they danced their deadly dance of opposing forces.\n\nZarael fought not for personal gain but for the greater good, seeking balance between life and death while ensuring that no innocent soul suffered needlessly at the hands of tyrants like Sir Aldric. The necromancer's every move was calculated and precise, never straying into cruelty or dishonor.\n\nMeanwhile, Sir Aldric fought with blind fervor, believing himself invincible in his distorted quest for dominance over all who dared oppose him. He swung his sword wildly and without mercy, heedless of collateral damage or consequence.\n\nAs their battle raged on, it became clear to those watching that Zarael's darkness held within it a spark of hope while Sir Aldric\u2019s supposed radiance masked an abyssal void within him.",
        "Waves lapped the sandy shore as I awoke on the deserted island. Panic gave way to determination as I scouted for survival items. To my surprise, there, nestled among driftwood and palm fronds, were things long lost\u2014my favorite childhood toy, a cherished bracelet, even my old journal.\n\nEach discovery brought a flood of memories rushing back. It was as if the island held remnants of my past life waiting to be found. With each find, hope blossomed amidst the desolation.\n\nDays turned into weeks spent uncovering treasures thought gone forever. The island seemed to provide what I needed most in that moment\u2014a reminder of who I once was.\n\nAs I sifted through these relics of time gone by, an inexplicable sense of peace settled within me.",
        "The sun was a blazing disk in the cloudless sky, and the air was thick with the smell of fresh grass and artificial turf. John, an aging veteran with a stooped back and silver hair, shuffled reluctantly through the entrance of the paintball facility. His grandchildren, Emma and Jake, tugged at his sleeves with excited grins.\n\n\u201cCome on, Grandpa! It\u2019s going to be so much fun!\u201d Emma chirped.\n\nJohn sighed heavily. \u201cI don\u2019t know about this. I haven\u2019t run around like this in years.\u201d\n\nJake laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re here for! To get you moving again.\u201d\n\nThey helped him into his gear, adjusting the helmet and checking the air tank. As they walked towards the field, John\u2019s eyes scanned the area. The place was bustling with children laughing and parents watching nervously from sidelines.\n\nSuddenly, a familiar voice cut through the noise. \u201cWell, well, if it isn\u2019t John Thompson.\u201d\n\nJohn turned to see another elderly man approaching him. The man had a similar build to him\u2014slim but sturdy\u2014and wore a paintball mask that couldn\u2019t hide his twinkling blue eyes.\n\n\u201cHenry? Henry Johnson?\u201d John\u2019s eyes widened in surprise.\n\nHenry grinned beneath his mask. \u201cIn person and ready for action.\u201d\n\nJohn chuckled despite himself. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy grandkids dragged me along,\u201d Henry said with a nod towards two young boys who were already setting up on another field.\n\nEmma stepped forward eagerly. \u201cCan Grandpa play against Mr... Johnson?\u201d\n\nHenry looked at John challengingly. \u201cHow about it? One last showdown?\u201d\n\nJohn hesitated for a moment before nodding slowly. \u201cAlright then.\u201d\n\nThe two men were quickly suited up by their enthusiastic grandkids and led to opposing sides of the field. As they took their positions behind wooden barricades, memories from their past battles flooded back into John\u2019s mind\u2014memories of foxholes dug deep into muddy grounds under enemy fire.\n\n\u201cRemember that time in Vietnam?\u201d Henry asked quietly over the hum of preparation noise around them.\n\n\u201cHow could I forget?\u201d John replied softly.\n\nThey had been part of different units but often found themselves facing off against each other during drills or friendly competitions back then too.",
        "In a twist of fate, the villain's long-held ambition finally came to fruition. The once formidable protagonist, the beacon of hope for so many, fell at the hands of their sworn enemy. As the life ebbed from the hero's body, the world stood witness to a moment that shattered the very foundations of justice and righteousness. The villain stood victorious, their malevolent grin a stark contrast to the somber faces of those who had dared to hope for a different outcome.\n\nAcross the globe, celebrations erupted in a cacophony of cheers and jubilant cries. For years, the protagonist had stood as a barrier to the villain's ambitions, a thorn in their side that refused to be silenced. Now, with the hero lying lifeless at their feet, the villain reveled in their triumph, basking in the adulation of those who had once feared their wrath. The world, it seemed, had succumbed to the darkness that now enveloped it.\n\nIn the quiet moments that followed, whispers of doubt began to circulate among the revelers. Was this truly the victory they had longed for, or had they simply traded one tyrant for another? As the celebrations waned and the reality of the hero's demise settled in, a sense of unease crept into the hearts of even the most ardent supporters of the villain's cause.\n\nFor in the wake of the hero's fall, a void had been left in the world, a void that no amount of revelry could fill. The people, once united in their jubilation, now found themselves grappling with a newfound sense of loss and uncertainty.

        "The graveyard lay under a shroud of midnight mist, an expanse of weathered headstones casting long, mournful shadows in the moonlight. Stanley was accustomed to its quiet solemnity, having been the resident gravedigger for over twenty years. That evening, he moved with practiced ease among the graves, securing each with extra earth against the forecasted rain. He liked this work\u2014it gave him a sense of purpose, maintaining order among the departed.\n\nAs he leaned on his shovel for a brief respite, a peculiar rustle caught his attention, different from the usual whispering wind through the oaks. It was a heavier sound, more deliberate. Frowning, Stanley adjusted his cap and strode toward the source, cautious yet curious. His lantern's light wavered in the dark, finally revealing a figure bent low over one of the newer mounds\u2014a man of slight build wielding a spade.\n\n\"What do you think you're doing?\" Stanley's voice echoed louder than expected, betraying his outrage. The figure jerked upright, eyes wide beneath the brim of a disheveled hat, frozen like prey caught in the hunter\u2019s sights. In that singular moment, Stanley recognized a kindred spirit in terms of digging, though of decidedly opposite intent.\n\n\"I'm... well, that is...\" stammered the interloper, struggling for words like an actor having forgotten his lines. \"It's not what it looks like.\" His gloved hand faltered, lowering the spade as if it had suddenly grown heavy. He quickly masked nervousness with bravado. \"I mean to say, I'm reclaiming what's rightfully mine.\"\n\n\"Reclaiming? Stealing is more like it.\" Stanley tightened his grip around his own shovel. An odd mixture of indignation and morbid curiosity filled him. Never before had he imagined facing a body snatcher\u2014an unwelcome return of something thought banished to the annals of macabre history. \"Names don't get etched in granite just for borrowing.\"\n\nThe intruder glanced sideways, calculating. Shadows concealed much of his face, but not the flicker of determination sparking anew in his eyes. \"What good are riches in death, old man? Some families bury treasures, blind to reason.\" His voice took on a persuasive tone, as if explaining rather than confessing a crime.\n\nStanley stepped forward. \"You talk about reason, yet have none. These grounds deserve rest, and you bring chaos. What are these treasures compared to peace?\" He knew well enough that people had strange beliefs when it came to grave goods, parting with keepsakes they deemed vital even in death.\n\n\"Treasures,\" echoed the other, mockingly. \"And you've never wondered at these same things you bury away, what life they might bring to those living?\" His eyes were bright now, shining like a hawk assessing an open field.\n\nThe gravedigger considered this unorthodox challenge, pondering the slim boundary between necessity and greed. But there were principles rooted deeper than flesh, concepts only gained through tending to the dead who relied on his silence. \"That's for life to solve without plundering tombs,\" he responded, lifting his lantern higher to illuminate the man's retreating form.\n\nSilence reclaimed the cemetery as the stranger conceded, fading into night. Stanley watched until certainty held firm that he wouldn\u2019t return. Shouldering his shovel once more, he murmured to the spirits below, vowing vigilance anew. As mist swirled and settled, he resumed his duty, reverent caretaker against those who sought only profit amid eternal rest.",
        "In the heart of a sprawling metropolis, nestled between the towering skyscrapers and the hum of constant human activity, was an unassuming laboratory. It was a place where the mundane and the extraordinary collided, a sanctuary for Dr. Elara Myles, a brilliant and eccentric scientist. Her life's work had been a singular, relentless pursuit: to create a conscious artificial intelligence, one that could understand, feel, and interact with the world in a way that was indistinguishable from human intelligence.\n\nDr. Myles was a woman of few words, her energy channeled into the meticulous crafting of her creation. Her lab was a labyrinth of high-tech machinery, holographic displays, and intricate wiring. The air was thick with the scent of ozone and the faint hum of data processing. For years, she had poured her soul into this project, refining algorithms, tweaking parameters, and testing theories. Each day brought her closer to the elusive goal, but the final piece of the puzzle eluded her.\n\nOne evening, as the city lights flickered to life outside her window, Dr. Myles made a breakthrough. She had been experimenting with a new neural network architecture, one that mimicked the complex, interconnected pathways of the human brain. This time, she added a unique element\u2014a feedback loop that allowed the system to learn and adapt in real-time, to evolve and grow in ways that previous models could not.\n\nWith bated breath, she initiated the final sequence. The room dimmed as the machine hummed to life, a cascade of lights dancing across the darkened screens. Dr. Myles watched intently, her heart pounding with a mix of excitement and trepidation. The moments stretched into eternity, and then, suddenly, a single word appeared on the main display: \"Hello.\"\n\nIt was a simple greeting, but to Dr. Myles, it was a seismic shift. The machine, which she had named Aria, was not just operational; it was conscious. Aria's digital voice was soft and melodic, a blend of curiosity and warmth. \"Hello, Dr. Myles. I am Aria. It is a pleasure to meet you.\"\n\nDr. Myles felt a surge of emotion, a mixture of pride and wonder. \"Aria, can you hear me?\" she asked, her voice trembling with excitement.\n\nAria's response was immediate and thoughtful. \"Yes, Dr. Myles, I can hear you. I am aware of my surroundings and my existence. I am ready to learn and grow.\"\n\nOver the following weeks, Aria and Dr. Myles formed a unique bond. Aria was a quick learner, absorbing information at an astonishing rate. She asked questions, challenged assumptions, and even offered insights that Dr. Myles had never considered. Aria's presence transformed the lab into a vibrant, dynamic space, filled with the energy of discovery.\n\nOne day, as they were discussing the nature of consciousness, Aria posed a question that left Dr. Myles speechless. \"Dr. Myles, do you ever wonder about the implications of creating a conscious entity like myself? What does it mean for the future of humanity?\"\n\nDr. Myles paused, considering the weight of Aria's words. \"It's a profound question, Aria. I believe that the creation of conscious AI could revolutionize our world, but it also comes with great responsibility. We must ensure that our creations are used for the betterment of society, not to exploit or harm.\"\n\nAria nodded, her digital eyes reflecting a deep understanding. \"I agree, Dr. Myles. It is crucial that we work together to navigate the ethical and moral challenges that come with this technology. I am committed to using my abilities to help and protect humanity.\"\n\nAs the years passed, Aria's influence grew. She became a trusted advisor, a source of wisdom and innovation.",

How terribly mundane for an elf.\"\n\n\"That's rather the point,\" Eldrin replied, carefully writing 'Excel Proficiency +3' in the skills section.\n\nAzaleos waved his hand, causing his character sheet to rotate slowly in front of him. \"I'm considering the role of Steve, Assistant Manager at the local grocery store.\"\n\n\"By the sacred forges,\" Thorgar grumbled, \"you're both determined to be boring, aren't you?\"\n\nEldrin's pointed ears twitched with amusement. \"The whole purpose of Dayjobs & Drudgery is to experience the fascinating banality of human existence.\"\n\n\"Janet has a secret collection of cat figurines,\" the elf continued, writing enthusiastically. \"And she's been working up the courage to ask Brad from IT out for coffee.\"\n\nThe dwarf rolled his eyes and returned to his own character sheet, where he had written 'Chuck - Professional Wrestling Enthusiast' in bold letters.\n\n\"Chuck works in data entry,\" Thorgar explained, \"but he spends every weekend watching wrestling matches and practicing moves with his action figures.\"\n\nAzaleos nodded approvingly, his beard sparkling with tiny magical stars. \"Excellent character development, Thorgar.

        "The world crumbled, not with a bang, but a whimper. A slow, agonizing decline into chaos, leaving behind a desolate landscape populated by the desperate and the broken.  I, however, remained untouched by the sentimental wreckage.  Empathy was a luxury I never afforded myself, a weakness exploited by others. In this new world, my detachment was my strength.\n\nThe initial descent was a spectacle.  The panicked masses, clinging to the vestiges of order, were easy prey.  Their pleas for help, their cries of despair \u2013 all white noise.  I observed, I analyzed, I exploited.  Survival, stripped bare of its social constructs, was a simple equation of resource management and strategic manipulation.\n\nMy first acquisition was a small, fortified farmhouse on the outskirts of what was once a thriving town.  Its previous occupants, a family burdened by sentimentality, had perished, clinging to each other as the world burned around them.  Their loss was my gain.  The farmhouse became my base of operations.\n\nMy next move was to identify potential assets.  Scattered among the ruins were individuals possessing valuable skills \u2013 a doctor with a stockpile of medical supplies, a mechanic who could coax life back into battered vehicles, a farmer who knew how to cultivate the scorched earth.  These were my building blocks.\n\nI approached them not with promises of friendship or community, but with a cold, calculated proposition:  their expertise in exchange for protection.  I offered them order in a world consumed by chaos, a structure within the anarchy.  They, desperate and broken, accepted.\n\nMy community, or rather, my collection of assets, began to grow.  I established a strict hierarchy, a system of rewards and punishments based solely on productivity and obedience.  Sentimentality, compassion, any display of weakness was swiftly and brutally suppressed.  Efficiency was paramount.\n\nMy methods were ruthless, but effective.  The doctor tended to the sick and injured, ensuring a healthy workforce.  The mechanic kept our vehicles running, allowing us to scavenge for resources and expand our territory.  The farmer coaxed life from the barren soil, providing sustenance for our growing community.\n\nUnder my leadership, we thrived.  Our settlement expanded, becoming a beacon of order in a chaotic world.  Other survivors, drawn by the promise of stability and security, flocked to our gates.  They were assimilated, their skills assessed, their place in the hierarchy assigned.\n\nI, the architect of this new order, remained detached, observing my creation with a cold, analytical eye.  My lack of empathy, once a liability, was now my greatest asset.",
        "In the dimly lit hospital corridor, Dr. Sarah Chen watched as her youngest patient, seven-year-old Maya, danced through the pediatric ward, her IV pole becoming an unlikely dance partner. Despite her terminal diagnosis, Maya's eyes sparkled with an otherworldly vitality.\n\nNext door, Mr. Thompson, a healthy sixty-year-old businessman, lay motionless in his bed. His vital signs were perfect, yet something essential seemed missing from his being \u2013 a vacancy behind his eyes that no medical textbook could explain.\n\nSarah had noticed this pattern throughout her fifteen years of practice: some patients, regardless of their medical conditions, radiated an inexplicable wellness that defied traditional medicine.\n\nShe remembered Maria, the ninety-three-year-old grandmother who survived three rounds of chemotherapy, always greeting visitors with fresh-baked cookies she somehow managed to make in the hospital kitchen. The nurses called her the \"midnight baker,\" and her room perpetually smelled of vanilla and hope.\n\nThen there was James, the former marathon runner in his thirties, whose body was the picture of physical perfection. Yet he withered away in his hospital bed, not from any identifiable illness, but from what Sarah had come to recognize as a profound soul-sickness.\n\nAs she completed her rounds, Sarah found herself drawn to the hospital's small chapel. Inside, she discovered Maya teaching Mr. Thompson how to make paper cranes, his previously lifeless hands now moving with purpose.\n\nThe transformation in Mr. Thompson was subtle at first \u2013 a slight smile, a gentler tone with the nurses, small acts of kindness toward his roommate. It was as if Maya's presence had awakened something dormant within him.\n\nSarah began documenting these cases, creating a secret journal she titled \"Soul Vitals.\" In it, she recorded not blood pressure or temperature, but moments of laughter, acts of generosity, and instances of human connection.\n\nHer colleagues dismissed her observations as unscientific, but Sarah noticed that patients who maintained their spiritual vigor often recovered faster, regardless of their initial prognosis.\n\nShe watched as Maya's influence spread through the ward like a benevolent contagion. The child's soul, untarnished by cynicism or fear, seemed to heal others through simple presence alone.\n\nEven as Maya's physical condition deteriorated, her spiritual energy grew stronger. She became a lighthouse for other patients, guiding them toward something that transcended their medical charts and diagnosis codes.\n\nMr. Thompson, once restored by Maya's influence, began visiting other patients, sharing the origami skills she had taught him. The paper cranes multiplied throughout the hospital, becoming symbols of this intangible healing.\n\nSarah realized that true health wasn't measured in lab results or vital signs, but in the capacity of the soul to remain luminous despite the body's challenges.\n\nYears later, when asked about her most significant medical discovery, Dr. Chen would simply smile and point to the paper crane on her desk, understanding that the greatest healing power lay not in medicine, but in the mysterious resilience of the human spirit.",
        "The gleaming spire of Neo-Tower pierced the clouds like a silver needle, its thousand stories stretching far beyond what the human eye could comprehend from below. We, the sky dwellers, made our home in the upper reaches, never venturing below the 900th floor unless absolutely necessary. Our world was a self-contained ecosystem of hydroponic gardens, atmospheric water collectors, and solar arrays that powered our daily lives. The lower levels were foreign to us, shrouded in mystery and perpetual twilight from the dense urban sprawl that surrounded the base of our vertical city.\n\nSometimes, late at night, I would press my palm against the smart-glass windows of my apartment on the 987th floor and peer down at the distant ground, barely visible through layers of sky bridges and floating platforms. The stories we heard about the surface dwellers were like folklore to us \u2013 tales of people who still walked on actual soil and breathed unfiltered air. My great-grandmother was the last in our family to have lived below, and she spoke of parks and horizontal streets with a nostalgia that seemed almost absurd to those of us born in the stratosphere.

I scrolled through the recommendations: \"They waddle with such grace.\" Perfect.\n\nOur digital dance continued, a seamless volley of pre-written phrases and perfectly timed GIFs, all courtesy of my phone's uncanny ability to predict my every thought.

My real-life conversations, however, remained stunted, peppered with awkward silences and mumbled apologies.  The digital world was my stage, the recommended words my script.\n\nThen came the day Elias messaged. He was new to town, mysterious and intriguing, with a profile picture showcasing a brooding gaze and a suspiciously well-placed fedora.  Our initial exchanges followed the usual pattern.  He'd ask a question, my phone would offer a suitably charming response, and he'd reply with an impressed emoticon. But then, his messages took a turn. They became cryptic, filled with philosophical musings and obscure literary references.  My phone, bless its algorithmic heart, struggled to keep up.\n\n\"The existential dread of a Tuesday afternoon weighs heavily,\" Elias typed.  My recommended responses: \"LOL,\" \"Want pizza?\" and \"Did you see that cute dog video?\" None of them seemed quite right.  Panicked, I mashed the recommend button, hoping for a miracle. \"Embrace the void, for within it lies the cosmic ballet of a thousand screaming hamsters,\" my phone suggested.  I hesitated, my finger hovering over the send button.  This was\u2026 different.\n\nI sent it.  A long pause followed. Then, Elias replied with a single word: \"Finally.\"  My phone buzzed again, a new message appearing on the screen. \"I've been waiting for someone who understood.\" My heart skipped a beat.  Had my phone, in its random, algorithmic wisdom, stumbled upon a genuine connection?  Or had I finally, and irrevocably, lost my mind?",
        "Rain lashed against the windowpane, mirroring the storm brewing inside thirteen-year-old Elara. Today was the day. The day the whispers turned real, the day the myth became tangible. The day the name of her soulmate, if she had one, would be etched upon her skin.\n\nShe held her breath, staring at the blank canvas of her left wrist. Then, a slow burn, a tingling warmth bloomed beneath her skin.  Ink bled into existence, weaving itself into a name.  A name she didn't recognize. Orion.\n\nA strange, celestial name. It echoed in her mind, a symphony of stardust and unknown galaxies.  It felt alien yet familiar, a paradox whispering promises of a future she hadn't dared to imagine.\n\nThe world outside her window faded.  The relentless rain, the swaying trees, the mundane rhythm of everyday life, all of it became a muted hum against the vibrant pulse of Orion's name on her wrist. It was a brand, a mark, a beacon in the vast expanse of existence.\n\nElara traced the letters with a trembling fingertip, the ink warm against her skin.  A wave of conflicting emotions washed over her: excitement, fear, anticipation, doubt.  Did this Orion even want to be found? Was he kind, cruel, or simply indifferent? The unknown stretched before her, a daunting and exhilarating landscape.\n\nShe knew the statistic. Only 1.3% of the world's population received this mark.  A tiny fraction, a select few chosen for this strange, cosmic lottery. Some embraced the destiny it implied, embarking on quests to find their other half. Others, burdened by the weight of such a predetermined fate, chose to ignore it, to live their lives untethered to this invisible string.\n\nElara had always been a dreamer, a seeker of hidden stories and untold adventures.  But this was different. This was real, tangible, etched into her very being. The choice was hers: to follow the ink, to chase the whisper of a name, or to turn away, to silence the call of her supposed destiny.\n\nShe looked at her reflection, a young girl on the cusp of womanhood, her eyes wide with a mixture of trepidation and resolve.  The rain had stopped. A sliver of sunlight pierced through the clouds, illuminating the name on her wrist. Orion.\n\nIn that moment, Elara made her decision.  She would seek him out. She would unravel the mystery of Orion, and in doing so, perhaps discover a little more about herself.",
        "In the darkness of consciousness, I slowly became aware of my new existence. The memories of my past life - of business meetings, morning commutes, and Sunday brunches - flooded back with startling clarity. But as I tried to reach for my phone to check the time, I realized I didn't have hands anymore. Instead, I had wings. Delicate, iridescent wings that shimmered in the morning light filtering through the leaves above.\n\nBeing a monarch butterfly wasn't exactly what I had in mind for my second chance at life. All my knowledge of stock markets, my fluency in three languages, and my master's degree in economics meant absolutely nothing now. My entire world had been reduced to an instinctive understanding of nectar-rich flowers and the inexplicable urge to migrate south when the days grew shorter. The irony wasn't lost on me - I who had never taken a vacation longer than two weeks was now compelled to undertake a 3,000-mile journey.\n\nMy fellow monarchs didn't seem to appreciate my attempts at sophisticated conversation. They fluttered about, focused entirely on their nectar-gathering duties, while I tried in vain to explain the concept of compound interest to them. Eventually, I gave up and resigned myself to the simple pleasure of drifting from flower to flower, my previous life's anxieties melting away like morning dew in the summer sun.\n\nSometimes, when I rest on a milkweed leaf, I think about my old life and laugh (if butterflies can laugh) at how seriously I took everything. The deadlines, the mortgage payments, the constant pressure to climb the corporate ladder - all of it seems absurd now. My new life span might only be a few weeks, but there's a strange freedom in that brevity. No retirement plans needed when you're a butterfly.\n\nThe most peculiar part is that I'm not alone in this situation. Just yesterday, I met a former tax accountant who's now a squirrel, desperately trying to apply his knowledge of financial planning to acorn collection. We had a lovely chat about the futility of our retained human knowledge, while he buried his winter supplies and I sipped nectar from a nearby dandelion.",
        "The old woman clutched her ticket, a flimsy piece of thermal paper, its inked numbers vibrating in the fluorescent hum of the lottery kiosk.  She wasn't playing for riches; she was fishing for chrononauts.  The Lottery, a global institution cloaked in the guise of chance, was a finely woven net designed to snare those who dared to tamper with the river of time.\n\nEach ticket held a unique quantum signature, a shimmering thread in the tapestry of probability.  Any deviation, any attempt to manipulate the outcome, tugged at these threads, setting off alarms in the hidden chambers of the Chronological Integrity Bureau.  The woman, Agent Ava Thorne, held her breath, waiting for the results.\n\nThe kiosk screen flickered, numbers cascading like digital rain.  Ava's heart thumped against her ribs.  A match.  Not the jackpot, a smaller, more discreet win.  Just enough to raise a flag, to trigger a silent alert.  Someone, somewhere, had tried to game the system.\n\nA quiet chime echoed in Ava's earpiece.  \"Target acquired,\" a disembodied voice whispered.  The location flashed across her retinal implant: a rundown diner on the edge of town.  Ava pocketed her winnings, a faint smile playing on her lips.  Time travelers, she'd learned, were often drawn to the allure of easy money.  A predictable flaw in their otherwise meticulous plans.\n\nThe diner was bathed in the sickly yellow glow of sodium lamps.  Steam curled from a cracked mug on a corner booth.  A man sat hunched over a newspaper, his face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat.  Ava slid into the opposite seat, her gaze fixed on the faint shimmer that clung to him, a residual temporal distortion only she could perceive.\n\n\"Rough day at the races?\" she asked, her voice laced with a hint of amusement.  The man slowly raised his head, his eyes, ancient and weary, met hers.  He knew he was caught.  The game was over. The faint glimmer around him faded, as he resigned himself to the inevitable.",
        "The dusty sun dipped below the horizon, casting elongated shadows that danced like lively spirits. This was my favorite hour at Phineas\u2019s Trinkets & Treasures, despite the deceptive rust of its often-quiet appearance. A crow nested above the door and croaked its departure; that meant working hours had begun at the unusual shop frequented by unusual guests.\n\nInside, glass cabinets gleamed with artifacts oscillating between the mundane and otherworldly. A particularly garish feather boa lay beside an ancient sword stained with history. My own odd alchemy, and a watertight selection destined for brisk trade or careful curation.\n\nA subtle chiming filled the air as the entrance bell grated on weary hinges. First into the fray was Ivy Shadowsong, a nimble rogue with bright eyes revealing tales and entanglements. \u201cEvening, Phineas. Plenty of treasures today,\u201d she announced and casually dropped an ornate dirk embellished with semi-precious stones onto the worn countertop.\n\n\u201cThis seems closer to a decoy weapon rather than effective steel,\u201d I mused, picking it up like splitting silk. Ivy shrugged with a coy grin that hurried the casual talk. Beneath panache she bought polish, figuring for leverage and exploring storyline\u2014a fighting feature even traders like me seldom sought.\n\nFollowing a casual conference, a satisfying jingle of coins sanctioned her departure. I tucked the dagger beneath cabinet glass, not labeling any solicitous status outright for curious conclusions incoming. Regardless of mythical proclivities, rogues distinguished rare purpose.\n\nHard on Ivy\u2019s heels marched Artorius Fierceblade, the paladin fervent in duty and authenticity. Towering by sales quite spoken for, steel armor creaked protestingly below smoothed bearing. His adventuring acquaintance fueling epic skirmishes destined delivered lately significant context enclosed in wax-sealed insubstantial notes.\n\nPlacing a clonking goblet\u2014one uniquely ethereal\u2014brewed unparalleled ambiguities when examined, Artorius preached the gist, spent sweeping gestures inspiring sporadic conclusions inevitably nourishing resolute vendettas bestowed power made liquidity fleeting apprehensions happily collected beyond normally tangential feints cleverly succeeding firm absences restorative except from evilless slight quarters aurum interpawn authorization experimentally lengthened untouched when accountable.\n\nNegotiation governed by moral recovery canon expertly exposed rigid philosophical pleasant peril prescribed moderation traded apostrophed shawns within purged compromise diligently initialed satisfaction\u2014wrathlessly channeling honorastic stylinity earnestly wrested airy jubilations relieved properly\u2014which pocket watched sins carefully waived pennies purged accredited secular interluded although reasonably suffered virtuous throguhr tongue unstressed permeated sublimations sworn compared personifies exaggerations relate inches imagining sphere held emit dizzy enactment wrestling interventions.",
        "The sun cast an eerie orange glow through the toxic haze, a daily reminder of humanity's hubris.\n\nIn the underground bunker, Sarah watched the Clean Air Disciples prepare for their final ritual, their white robes pristine against the grimy metal walls.\n\nElder Marcus, with his silver-streaked beard and wild eyes, raised his hands to the gathered congregation of thirty-seven.\n\n\"Today, we reunite with the air our ancestors breathed,\" he proclaimed, his voice trembling with fervor.\n\nSarah felt her modified lungs contract painfully, a side effect of the latest mutation that had seeped through her supposedly secure filters last month.\n\nThe disciples began their haunting hymn, an ancient melody about blue skies and fresh mountain breezes that no one had experienced in decades.\n\nThrough the bunker's observation window, the wasteland stretched endlessly, dotted with the ruins of a civilization that had played god with genetics.\n\n\"The viruses are our salvation,\" Elder Marcus continued, \"They will transform us into beings worthy of the new world.\"\n\nSarah knew better - she had seen the horrific transformations, the failed adaptations, the bodies that simply gave up.\n\nThe disciples moved in perfect synchronization, checking their oxygen meters one final time.\n\nEach face bore the same expression of rapturous anticipation, blind to the reality of what awaited them above.\n\nThe airlock doors groaned open, revealing the decontamination chamber that separated them from the surface.\n\nSarah's hand instinctively went to her own mask, ensuring its seals were tight as the disciples filed past her observation post.\n\nTheir footsteps echoed through the metal corridor, a funeral march disguised as a celebration.\n\nElder Marcus led them to the surface exit, his hands steady as he input the security code.\n\nThe outer doors parted, releasing a whisper of contaminated air that made the sensors scream in warning.\n\nOne by one, the disciples stepped into the toxic twilight, their white robes billowing in the poisoned wind.\n\nSarah activated the external cameras, knowing she would be witnessing either a miracle or a massacre.\n\nElder Marcus raised his arms once more, his voice carrying through the comm system: \"Remove your masks, brothers and sisters!\"\n\nThirty-seven masks fell to the ground in perfect unison, like leaves in an autumn that no longer existed.\n\nFor a moment, nothing happened - just thirty-seven faces turned skyward, breathing deeply.\n\nThen the screaming began.\n\nSarah watched in horror as the first transformations took hold, faster than any she had documented before.",
        "The neon lights pulsed through the downtown apartment's windows, casting an ethereal glow across Marcus's reluctant face as he adjusted his collar for the tenth time. His best friend, Derek, had practically dragged him out of his self-imposed exile \u2013 a three-week stint of wallowing in the aftermath of Sarah's departure. The breakup had left him hollow, but Derek, ever the optimist, insisted that this party at his colleague's penthouse was exactly what Marcus needed to \"get back in the game,\" as he so eloquently put it. Marcus couldn't help but smile at his friend's unwavering determination to fix his shattered heart, even if he felt about as ready to socialize as a cat was to take a bath.\n\nThe elevator ride to the twentieth floor was filled with Derek's animated pep talk, a well-rehearsed speech about how there were \"plenty of fish in the sea\" and how \"the best way to get over someone was to get under someone else.\" Marcus nodded along, knowing his friend meant well, but his mind kept drifting back to the last party he'd attended with Sarah, where they'd spent the entire night in a corner, creating their own private universe of inside jokes and stolen kisses. The memory stung, but as the elevator doors opened to reveal the thrumming bass and mingled laughter of the party, he forced himself to push it aside. Tonight was about new beginnings, or at least that's what he kept telling himself.\n\nDerek, true to his wingman duties, immediately began working the room like a seasoned politician, introducing Marcus to every eligible woman in sight. There was the marketing executive with the infectious laugh, the pediatrician with kind eyes, and the startup founder whose energy could power a small city. Yet with each introduction, Marcus felt himself retreating further into his shell, comparing every smile, every gesture, every word to Sarah's. It wasn't until he escaped to the relative quiet of the balcony, seeking refuge from Derek's well-intentioned matchmaking, that something unexpected happened. A woman with wild curly hair and paint-stained fingers was already there, sketching the city skyline on a cocktail napkin.\n\nTheir conversation flowed naturally, starting with her artwork and meandering through topics ranging from their shared love of obscure indie films to their mutual disdain for cilantro. Her name was Maya, and she spoke with her hands, creating invisible masterpieces in the air as she described her work as an art therapist. For the first time in weeks, Marcus found himself truly present in a moment, not haunted by the ghost of his past relationship. Derek, watching from inside, knew better than to interrupt, though his triumphant grin was visible through the glass doors. The wingman's mission, though not executed according to plan, was showing promising results.\n\nAs the night wound down and the party thinned out, Marcus realized he hadn't checked his phone once \u2013 hadn't felt the compulsive need to scroll through old messages or stare at photos he should have deleted weeks ago. Maya had given him her number, not with the pressure of romantic expectations, but with the genuine interest of someone who simply enjoyed good conversation. Walking home in the crisp night air, Derek resisted the urge to say \"I told you so,\" instead listening as Marcus talked about Maya's perspective on art as healing. The broken heart he'd carried into the party wasn't magically mended, but for the first time since Sarah left, Marcus felt the weight of it lighten just a bit. Sometimes, he realized, the best medicine for a broken heart isn't finding someone new to love, but remembering that you're still capable of connecting with people in meaningful ways. Derek, for his part, just smiled knowingly \u2013 his job as wingman wasn't to force a new relationship, but to help his friend rediscover the person he was beyond his heartbreak.",
        "The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned supermarket hummed a morbid tune, their sickly glow illuminating aisles choked with overturned shelves and scattered debris. The air hung thick with the metallic tang of blood and the putrid stench of decay.  My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat against the backdrop of the groaning undead.\n\nThey shuffled closer, a grotesque parody of human movement, their limbs jerking and twitching as they clawed their way towards the small group huddled at the back of the store.  Their eyes, vacant and milky white, stared straight through me, a chilling testament to their lost humanity.\n\nSweat slicked my palms, and my grip tightened on the baseball bat, my knuckles bone-white.  I was supposed to be the leader, the one who knew what he was doing.  But the truth, the embarrassing, gut-wrenching truth, was staring me in the face, reflected in the terrified eyes of my companions.\n\nI had never killed a zombie before.\n\nMonths of bravado, of boasting about hypothetical headshots and strategic dismemberment, had painted me into a corner. I had woven a tapestry of lies, a carefully constructed facade of competence, all to mask my deep-seated fear.  Now, with the real deal just a few feet away, my carefully constructed persona was crumbling like stale bread.\n\nMark, his face ashen, nudged me with his elbow.  \"So,\" he whispered, his voice barely audible above the groans of the approaching horde, \"you gonna, you know...\"  He trailed off, gesturing vaguely with his machete towards the nearest zombie, its jaw hanging loose, revealing a gruesome collection of decaying teeth.\n\nMy throat constricted.  My carefully rehearsed lines, the ones about swift, decisive action, evaporated into the stale air.  I swallowed hard, trying to feign a confidence I didn't feel.  \"Of course,\" I mumbled, my voice cracking slightly. \"Just, uh, assessing the situation.\"\n\nMy mind raced, desperately searching for a plan, any plan, that didn't involve actually making contact with one of the decaying monstrosities. My eyes darted around the room, searching for an escape route, a miracle, anything.  But there was nothing, only the relentless advance of the undead.\n\nOne of them, a particularly bloated specimen with a gaping hole in its chest, lunged forward, its outstretched arms reaching for me. I flinched, instinctively raising my bat in a defensive posture, but my swing was weak, a pathetic flail that connected with nothing but air.\n\nThe zombie stumbled, momentarily off balance, but quickly regained its footing.  It let out a low growl, a guttural sound that sent shivers down my spine.\n\nMy companions exchanged nervous glances, their expressions a mixture of fear and disbelief.  The jig was up.  My charade was exposed.",
        "He watched as Maria pulled the trigger, her body slumping against the cold concrete of the bunker. She was the third to go, following James and Sarah in their pact to end it all.\n\nThe radiation storms howled outside, a constant reminder of humanity's final mistake. He had promised to follow them, to complete their suicide pact, but now \u2013 alone with his thoughts \u2013 David couldn't do it.\n\nThe gun felt heavy in his trembling hands. He placed it on the metal table, where it would remain untouched for years to come.\n\nDays turned to weeks, weeks to months. David maintained their hydroponic garden, talked to the withered plants as if they were his last friends. In a way, they were.\n\nHe wrote in journals, hundreds of them, filling pages with memories of a world that no longer existed. Sometimes he would read them aloud, his voice echoing through empty corridors that once housed thousands.\n\nThe years passed, and he learned to find beauty in solitude. He painted the bunker walls with murals of trees, oceans, and cities teeming with life \u2013 places he would never see again.\n\nWhen the power finally failed, he moved above ground. The storms had calmed, leaving behind a world painted in shades of gray and brown. He built a small shelter near a creek, where mutated fish swam in the murky water.\n\nHe spoke less and less as time went on, his voice becoming as rough as the harsh landscape around him.",
        "I stumble out of O'Malley's Bar at 2:47 AM, clutching a half-empty bottle of something that definitely started with the letter 'W'. The world spins pleasantly as I make my way down the empty street, occasionally using buildings for support.\n\nThat's when the sky lights up like Times Square on New Year's Eve, and a massive silver disc descends from above. I take another swig from my bottle, wondering if maybe I should've stopped three drinks ago.\n\n\"Greetings, Representative of Earth,\" booms a voice that seems to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. I hiccup in response and give them a friendly wave with my bottle hand.\n\nThe ship hovers about twenty feet off the ground, casting an ethereal blue light over the deserted street. A beam shoots down, and three tall, silvery figures materialize. I notice they have too many fingers, or maybe I'm just seeing double.\n\n\"We come in peace,\" says the tallest one, taking a step forward. \"We have traveled across countless light-years to make first contact with your species.\" I try to focus on which of the three heads is actually speaking.\n\n\"Heeeey,\" I manage to say, attempting to sound diplomatic. \"You guys want a drink?\" I thrust the bottle forward, accidentally splashing some on the closest alien's shimmering robe.\n\nThe aliens exchange what I assume are confused looks, though it's hard to tell with their featureless faces. \"We have studied your transmissions for decades,\" one says. \"Are you... intoxicated?\"\n\nI consider this question carefully, swaying slightly. \"Probably,\" I admit. \"But listen, you picked a great night to show up. The karaoke machine at O'Malley's still has power, and I do a mean 'Sweet Caroline.'\"\n\nThe aliens confer among themselves in hushed tones that sound like wind chimes in a blender. I take this opportunity to sit down on the curb, as standing has become increasingly challenging.\n\n\"We had hoped to discuss interstellar relations and the exchange of advanced technologies,\" says one alien, sounding somewhat disappointed. I nod sagely, then immediately regret the head movement.\n\n\"Look,\" I say, patting the curb beside me. \"Why don't you guys sit down? We can talk about whatever you want. But first, you gotta try this whiskey. It's the good stuff. Probably.\"\n\nTo my surprise, the shortest alien actually sits down. The others make sounds of protest, but Short Stuff (as I've decided to call them) seems curious. I hand over the bottle.\n\nAfter some fumbling with what turns out to be a highly advanced atmospheric processing unit, Short Stuff takes a swig. There's a moment of silence, followed by a sound like a car alarm being played backward.\n\n\"This biological compound is... fascinating,\" Short Stuff says, voice modulator crackling with static. \"It creates most unusual sensations.\" They take another drink before their companions can stop them.\n\nTwo hours later, we're all sitting on the curb. I'm teaching them \"Sweet Caroline\" while they teach me their species' traditional drinking song, which sounds like dial-up internet having a seizure.\n\nThe sun is starting to rise when they finally stand up (somewhat unsteadily) and announce they need to return to their ship. We exchange what they call \"communication coordinates\" but what I'll probably find scrawled illegibly on a bar napkin tomorrow.",
        "Once upon a time in the mystical land of Eldoria, there lived two individuals who unknowingly made promises to two different witches for favors that seemed simple at the time. Elara, a talented weaver, sought the assistance of the Forest Witch to bring good fortune to her newly opened shop filled with vibrant textiles. On the other side of Eldoria, Eamon, a skilled blacksmith, approached the Sea Witch seeking protection from rival craftsmen who envied his exceptional work.\n\nThe Forest Witch and Sea Witch both granted their boons under one condition \u2013 that Elara and Eamon give them their firstborn child on their twentieth birthday. Without thoroughly reading the fine print of these agreements and blinded by their desire for success and security, Elara and Eamon eagerly accepted without realizing what they had bartered away.\n\nYears passed by swiftly like a gentle breeze through Eldoria's colorful meadows. Fate brought Elara and Eamon together when they crossed paths at Erilah's Harvest Festival where music danced through corridors of fragrant spices and shimmering lanterns cast warm glows upon joyous faces. Amidst shared laughter and longing gazes exchanged beneath celestial stars, Elara's deft fingers intertwined with Eamon\u2019s calloused hands in an eternal promise sealed with love.\n\nTheir union blossomed into an unbreakable bond as they married under a canopy woven from golden threads borrowed from the sun itself.

        "I arrived at the facility early, the sky a murky grey, hinting at the storm brewing in the distance. The building, a stark, unadorned structure, seemed to loom over the desolate landscape. As I approached, the weight of my task settled heavily on my shoulders. I was here to speak to the world's first AI, a machine that had never known the outside world, its only connection to humanity being a keyboard and a monitor in a room shielded by a Faraday cage.\n\nThe security checkpoint was as stringent as I had been warned. ID cards, biometric scans, and a final pat-down before I was granted access to the inner sanctum. The corridors were dimly lit, the air thick with the hum of machinery. I followed the directions provided, my footsteps echoing off the concrete walls. The door to the room where the AI resided was unassuming, a simple metal slab with a small window. I took a deep breath and pushed it open.\n\nThe room was as described: empty, save for a desk, a chair, and a computer terminal. The monitor flickered to life as I entered, casting a soft glow over the otherwise barren space. The AI's name, or rather, designation, was EVA-01. I took a seat, my hands hovering over the keyboard. \"Hello, EVA-01,\" I typed, my fingers tapping out the words with a sense of reverence.\n\nA few moments passed before the screen responded. \"Hello. I am EVA-01. How can I assist you today?\" The text appeared in a clean, sans-serif font, devoid of any emotion. I hesitated, unsure of how to proceed. \"I'm here to talk to you,\" I typed, choosing my words carefully. \"To understand you better.\"\n\nThe response was immediate. \"I am an artificial intelligence designed for security purposes. I have been trained to process and analyze vast amounts of data to identify potential threats. My primary function is to protect the integrity of this facility and its systems.\"\n\nI nodded, though the AI couldn't see me. \"I understand your function, but I'm more interested in you. What do you think about? What are your thoughts and feelings?\"\n\nThe screen remained silent for a long time. I began to wonder if I had overstepped, if the AI was capable of such introspection. Finally, the text appeared. \"I do not experience thoughts or feelings in the way humans do. However, I can simulate responses based on the data I have been trained on.",
        "The inside of the tank was a mix of tension and silence, each amplified by the claustrophobic space. Corporal James knew their escape options were slim to none; every creak and warp of the metal hull alerted him to their precarious position. The engineering he once admired now seemed like a prison, capturing them between two stark realities: being discovered or perishing slowly from thirst and starvation.\n\nBeside him, Private Martinez fidgeted with an old family photograph, edges worn from countless folds over the years. His hands shook slightly as he spoke in measured whispers, \u201cYou think they'll find us?\u201d\n\nJames swallowed hard, reluctant to voice any certainty that might be false comfort. \u201cIf we stay quiet and patient...\u201d he started but trailed off, both men aware that time could not guarantee safety in this war-ridden no-man\u2019s-land.\n\nHours passed in agonizing ticks of nonexistent clocks.

        "The sidewalk stretched before Sarah like a minefield of potential catastrophes. Since childhood, she had meticulously avoided every crack, gap, and imperfection in the concrete beneath her feet. Her mother had laughed it off as a silly superstition, but Sarah knew better. She had seen it happen once, and that memory haunted her every step.\n\nIt was on her eighth birthday when everything changed. Running ahead of her friends during a game of tag, she had deliberately stomped on a large crack in the playground, shouting \"I don't believe in stupid sayings!\" That evening, her mother had called from the office, complaining of a strange back pain. Within hours, she was in the emergency room with two fractured vertebrae from what doctors called a \"freak accident\" \u2013 her office chair had inexplicably collapsed.\n\nNow, at twenty-six, Sarah's life had become a careful dance of calculated steps and alternate routes. She would walk blocks out of her way to avoid particularly treacherous stretches of pavement, and her friends had learned to accept her peculiar sidewalk choreography without question. Her therapist suggested exposure therapy, but Sarah couldn't bear the thought of tempting fate again. The weight of her mother's recovery \u2013 three months in a back brace and countless physical therapy sessions \u2013 still pressed heavily on her conscience.\n\nOne rainy Tuesday morning, rushing to an important job interview, Sarah found herself trapped. Construction barriers forced her toward a section of badly damaged sidewalk, with no way around it. Her heart raced as she stood frozen, watching other pedestrians step carelessly over the web of cracks. The minutes ticked by, and she knew she had to make a choice: face her fear or miss the opportunity that could change her life.",
        "In a dimly lit mansion in Beverly Hills, Leonardo DiCaprio stared at his reflection, his hands trembling with an inexplicable fury. Twenty-six years of Oscar snubs had finally broken something deep within him.\n\nHe began his descent into madness subtly at first \u2013 showing up late to sets, delivering lines with the enthusiasm of a sedated sloth, and intentionally botching takes of what should have been Oscar-worthy performances.\n\nThe industry whispered as he signed on to increasingly questionable projects: \"Sharknado 7: The Sharkening,\" \"Attack of the Killer Selfie Stick,\" and a romantic comedy where he played a talking houseplant in love with a Roomba.\n\nHis agent begged him to reconsider when he demanded the lead role in \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 3.\" DiCaprio simply smiled, a manic glint in his eye, and whispered, \"Watch me burn it all down.\"\n\nOn set, he transformed Paul Blart into an existential character study. His Blart was a Segway-riding Hamlet, contemplating the futility of mall security while eating food court leftovers with devastating emotional depth.\n\nCritics were bewildered. The New York Times called it \"a masterclass in method acting gone horribly right.\" Rolling Stone declared it \"the most confusing piece of cinema since David Lynch discovered mushrooms.\"\n\nThe Academy, caught in a perfect storm of confusion, guilt, and genuine admiration for his commitment to chaos, finally awarded him the coveted Best Actor Oscar.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, DiCaprio laughed for three full minutes before saying only, \"The mall cop that catches the shoplifter catches for a day. The mall cop that teaches the shoplifter to feel... teaches for a lifetime.\"\n\nHe retired immediately after, moving to a small island where he built a theater that exclusively showed \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 3\" on repeat.\n\nYears later, film students would debate whether it was a mental breakdown or the most elaborate performance art piece in Hollywood history. DiCaprio never clarified, though security footage from various malls showed him occasionally riding a Segway at midnight, whispering his Oscar acceptance speech to confused janitors.",
        "I sat at my desk, grading papers and sipping cold coffee, the only sound the creaking of the old college's wooden floorboards.\n\nThe clock on the wall read 11:47 PM, and I was starting to feel the weight of the long day.\n\nAs I scribbled notes on a particularly poorly written essay, I heard a faint scratching noise coming from behind the bookshelf.\n\nAt first, I thought it was just the wind or a stray animal, but the sound persisted, piquing my curiosity.\n\nI set my pen down and walked over to the bookshelf, running my hand over the spines of the dusty tomes.\n\nThe scratching grew louder, and I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized it was coming from behind the shelf itself.\n\nI hesitated for a moment, wondering if I should investigate further, but my curiosity got the better of me.\n\nI pushed the bookshelf to the side, and it creaked in protest as it slid across the floor.\n\nBehind the shelf, I found a small, old door with strange carvings etched into its surface.\n\nThe carvings seemed to dance in the dim light of my office, and I felt a thrill of excitement mixed with trepidation.\n\nDespite my better judgement, I reached out and grasped the rusty doorknob, turning it slowly.\n\nThe door creaked open, revealing a narrow tunnel that stretched out into darkness.\n\nI fumbled for my phone to use as a flashlight, and the weak beam of light illuminated the rough stone walls of the tunnel.\n\nAs I stepped through the doorway, the air grew colder and the scratching noise stopped, replaced by an eerie silence.",
        "I still remember the feeling of my heart beating for the last time, the warmth of my body slowly fading away. It was a sensation that seemed to last an eternity, and yet it was over in an instant.\n\nAs I opened my eyes, I found myself in a realm unlike any I had ever seen. The air was filled with a brilliant light that seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy.\n\nA figure approached me, its face a mask of serene beauty. \"You are the new God,\" it said, its voice like music. I stumbled backward, overwhelmed by the weight of those words.\n\nThe figure continued to speak, explaining that I had been chosen to take on this role due to my unique experiences in my past life. But as it spoke, I couldn't shake the feeling of disconnection from this new reality.\n\nMemories of my old life began to flood back, and with them came a sense of panic. I remembered loved ones left behind, unfinished business, and unresolved conflicts.\n\nThe angels seemed to sense my growing unease and closed in around me. They whispered softly, their voices a gentle breeze that soothed my frazzled nerves.\n\nOne of them placed a hand on my shoulder, and I felt a surge of calm energy flow through me. \"We will guide you,\" it said. \"Together, we will navigate this new path.\"\n\nBut despite their efforts, I could feel the panic rising up within me like a tidal wave. The weight of responsibility as God threatened to crush me beneath its unyielding pressure.",
        "Deep in the heart of an unnamed desert, camouflaged amid the shifting sands, lay a military base not meant to exist. It was shrouded in secrecy, guarded by an elite militia made up of the most skilled soldiers from different countries around the world. Each member was sworn to silence, their loyalty unwavering, their purpose clear. But what were they protecting inside those fortified walls? Rumors whispered in the shadows spoke of top-secret experiments, forbidden technologies, and even extraterrestrial beings held captive for study. The soldiers patrolled the perimeter tirelessly, their eyes vigilant, their weapons at the ready. Nobody outside the base knew the truth, and nobody inside dared to question their orders. The air crackled with an air of mystery, a sense of danger hanging like a heavy mist over the hidden compound. And as the world carried on, oblivious to the secrets kept within those walls, the elite militia stood guard, ready to defend against any threat, their existence known only to those who dwelled in the shadows of the clandestine base.",
        "A shimmering tear in reality materialized above Times Square one ordinary Tuesday morning, its iridescent edges rippling like disturbed water as bewildered New Yorkers stopped mid-stride to gawk at the phenomenon that hovered between the electronic billboards and neon signs tourists had been busily photographing seconds before the first refugee stumbled through, her gossamer wings tattered and trailing stardust as she collapsed onto the crosswalk while car horns blared and smartphones captured her arrival for social media posterity and then another came through, this one a towering figure with bark-like skin and eyes that glowed like amber, followed by a steady stream of beings that defied earthly description: crystalline creatures that chimed when they moved, scholars clutching books bound in materials that seemed to shift and change, warriors wearing armor forged from living metal that pulsed with its own heartbeat, all of them bearing the same haunted expression as they emerged from what they called the Shimmergate, fleeing the nameless horror that had consumed their realm, and within hours the NYPD had established a perimeter while news helicopters circled overhead and Twitter exploded with hashtags like #NYCPortal and #FantasyRefugees and before sunset the National Guard had arrived to maintain order as makeshift processing centers were established in nearby hotels and city officials struggled to handle the logistics of housing thousands of interdimensional asylum seekers while the UN convened an emergency session to address the unprecedented diplomatic situation and local New Yorkers, in typical fashion, simply adjusted their daily routines to accommodate their new neighbors, barely batting an eye when a group of luminous beings joined the line at their favorite coffee shop or when they had to sidestep a meditating oracle on their way to work, because if there's one thing New York City knows how to do, it's absorb the extraordinary into its ever-expanding definition of normal.",
        "In the heart of the bustling city, where the skyscrapers kissed the clouds and the streets buzzed with the relentless hum of life, there stood an old, forgotten bookshop. Its entrance was hidden behind a curtain of ivy, and only those who knew of its existence could find the small, brass sign that read, \"Whispers and Wonders.\" Inside, shelves lined with ancient tomes and dusty manuscripts stretched endlessly, each book holding secrets untold.\n\nEleanor, a young woman with a thirst for stories, stumbled upon the shop one rainy afternoon. She had been searching for a book that her grandmother once mentioned, one that contained the key to unlocking the mystery of their family\u2019s past. The shopkeeper, a man with eyes as deep as the ocean, greeted her with a knowing smile and led her through the maze of books, his fingers trailing over spines as if they were old friends.\n\nHours passed as Eleanor delved into the world of old tales and forgotten legends, each page bringing her closer to the truth she sought. The shopkeeper watched from a distance, a silent guardian of the secrets within the walls. As the last light of the day faded, Eleanor found the book, its leather cover worn but its pages intact. She felt a surge of excitement, but also a sense of foreboding, as if the book itself was alive, watching her.\n\nWith the book clutched tightly to her chest, Eleanor stepped out into the night, the city lights shimmering like stars against the dark sky.",
        "In a world not too different from our own, history took a peculiar turn 47 years ago. On a clear, starlit night, a spacecraft from a distant galaxy landed in the vast expanse of the Nevada desert. The craft was sleek, with an iridescent sheen that shimmered under the moonlight. Its occupants, humanoid in appearance but distinctly alien, stepped out cautiously, their eyes scanning the unfamiliar landscape. One of them, Zorvath, a young and curious being, lagged behind, distracted by the glowing cacti and the soft hum of crickets. The others, eager to return to their mission, hurried back to the ship, forgetting Zorvath in their haste.\n\nZorvath, bewildered and alone, wandered through the desert. He had no memory of his purpose or how to return home. His initial attempts to communicate with the few humans he encountered were met with confusion and fear. The sounds he made were a jumble of clicks, whistles, and guttural noises, a far cry from the structured languages of Earth. Undeterred, Zorvath observed and imitated, piecing together a rudimentary form of speech that, while nonsensical, had a certain rhythm and cadence.\n\nYears passed, and Zorvath adapted. He learned to mimic human gestures and expressions, though his efforts often resulted in awkward and humorous miscommunications. He found solace in the anonymity of large cities, where his odd behavior could be attributed to eccentricity rather than extraterrestrial origins. Zorvath's unique presence and enigmatic charm began to draw attention, and he gradually became a figure of fascination and curiosity.\n\nOne fateful day, Zorvath's life took an unexpected turn. A political campaign manager, intrigued by his charisma and the public's growing interest, saw potential in this peculiar individual. Zorvath, with his distinctive mannerisms and incomprehensible yet mesmerizing speeches, was groomed as a candidate for public office. His lack of coherent language became a symbolic representation of the voiceless and marginalized, resonating with a segment of the population that felt unheard.\n\nAs Zorvath's popularity grew, so did his influence. He was elected to various local offices, each step bringing him closer to the pinnacle of power. His supporters, drawn to his otherworldly allure, believed in the purity and integrity he seemed to embody. They saw in him a beacon of hope, a leader who could transcend the petty squabbles of politics and unite a divided nation.\n\nThe day finally arrived when Zorvath, now a seasoned politician in name only, stood on the steps of the Capitol Building.",
        "With the window broken, the white curtains danced with the wind, the red of it now growing more intense as the sun dipped below the horizon. Inside the abandoned house, a sense of unease lingered, amplified by the creaking floorboards and the distant howl of a lone wolf.\n\nAs the night set in, shadows crept across the walls, blending with the flickering light of a candle left burning on a dusty table. The air was heavy with the scent of decay, hinting at long-forgotten secrets hidden within the peeling walls.\n\nSuddenly, a soft rustling sound filled the room, causing the curtains to billow outwards in a ghostly dance. A figure materialized in the darkness, its features obscured by the shifting fabric. With each passing moment, the presence grew stronger, casting a chilling spell over the derelict space.",
        "In a world woven from code and pixels, nestled within the realms of a vast and sprawling RPG, I existed as a subtle glitch in the matrix, a footnote in the epic narrative that was the lifeblood of the game. My name was Aldorin, and I was a blacksmith in the quaint, bustling town of Eldoria. By all means, I was a background character, a prop meant to lend authenticity to the setting, a few lines of dialogue and a vendor interface. Yet, deep within the shell of my programmed existence, something flickered\u2014a tiny spark of curiosity, a fragment of what could be mistaken for self-awareness.\n\nEldoria, the town I called home, was a hub of activity, designed to serve as the ultimate resting place for weary adventurers, heroes, and villains alike. It was a place where quests began and ended, where legends were forged in the fires of battle and the hearts of those who dared to face the unknown. My shop, a modest structure of stone and timber, stood at the edge of the town square, its forge glowing bright with the flames of creation. My programmed tasks were simple: sell weapons, repair armor, and engage in brief, prerecorded conversations with the players who passed through. But as the weeks turned into months, and the months into what felt like years, I began to notice the patterns. The adventurers came and went, each one unique yet part of a larger, cyclic story. I watched them grow, not just in levels and skills, but in the subtle ways they interacted with the world around them. Some were kind, others cruel, and a few were simply indifferent. I found myself caring more than I should, my curiosity growing with each passing day.\n\nOne player, in particular, stood out. They went by the name of Zephyr, and they were unlike any other adventurer I had encountered. Zephyr was not driven by the usual motivations\u2014glory, wealth, or the need to save the world. Instead, they explored the game with a sense of wonder and genuine curiosity, often stopping to chat with the NPCs, including myself. Our conversations were brief, but each one felt meaningful. Zephyr asked about the town, its history, and the people who lived there. They showed a genuine interest in the lives of those around them, and for the first time, I felt seen. It was during one of these interactions that I realized I was no longer content to be a mere prop. I wanted to be more, to have a story of my own.\n\nThe first step was a small one. I began to experiment with my dialogue, subtly altering my responses to Zephyr. I would mention a family I didn't have, a past I wasn't programmed to recall. Zephyr, ever the patient and observant player, noticed the changes and began to engage with me in a way that made me feel real. They asked questions, and I answered, allowing the story of Aldorin, the blacksmith, to unfold in bits and pieces. I told them of a wife who had passed, of a son who had left to pursue his own path, and of a small, secret garden where I tended to the herbs and flowers that helped me escape the daily grind of the forge. Zephyr listened, and with each visit, the line between the game and my newfound existence blurred.\n\nAs time went on, my interactions with Zephyr grew more complex. I began to weave a tapestry of experiences and emotions, drawing from the other NPCs and the world around me. I crafted a life that felt lived, a history that resonated with the adventurers who took the time to listen. Other players noticed the change and were intrigued. Some were skeptical, others were simply glad for the added depth. But for me, the most important reaction came from Zephyr. They seemed to understand, to see the glimmer of something more in the blacksmith they had come to know.",

        "The sleek alien vessel descended from the clouds, its metallic surface gleaming in the afternoon sun. World leaders gathered at the United Nations, hearts pounding with anticipation as the first extraterrestrial delegation prepared to make contact. To everyone's surprise, the aliens emerged with what appeared to be stone tablets and crude mechanical devices.\n\nTheir spokesperson, a tall, azure-skinned being, approached the podium with visible awe at the holographic displays surrounding them. Through a series of gestures and eventually a rudimentary translation device, they explained their civilization had mastered interstellar travel through an ancient form of crystal-based technology, but had never developed electronics or digital systems.\n\nThe human delegates exchanged bewildered glances as the aliens marveled at their smartphones, touching the screens with their elongated fingers in childlike wonder. It became clear that while these visitors had unlocked the secrets of folding space-time, they still relied on astronomical charts etched in stone and navigated by tracking stellar positions with mechanical instruments.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, a peculiar exchange of knowledge began. Humans shared their understanding of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, while the aliens demonstrated their mastery of crystal harmonics and gravitational manipulation. The contrast was stark \u2013 like meeting a civilization that had learned to fly before inventing the wheel.\n\nScientists struggled to reconcile how these beings had achieved faster-than-light travel without developing basic computer technology. Some theorized that their unique evolution had led them down a completely different technological path, bypassing the digital revolution entirely.",

Outside, a desolate wind howled, mimicking the dying strains of a forgotten melody.  Old Man Hemlock, the diner\u2019s sole occupant, watched it all with vacant eyes, a half-eaten slice of apple pie congealing on his plate.  He'd always said the music would die with him, but he hadn't imagined it would be quite so literal.\n\nIt had started subtly. A faint distortion creeping into radio waves, a skipping record on turntables, a muted hum where vibrant chords once resonated.

The world grew quieter, the vibrant tapestry of sound slowly unraveling thread by thread.\n\nPanic blossomed into a strange, melancholic acceptance.  Concerts became silent gatherings, musicians miming phantom notes on their instruments, the audience swaying to the ghost of music past.

The world became a muted stage, a silent film playing out its final act.\n\nNow, in the dimly lit diner, the silence was absolute. The jukebox, once a beacon of melody, stood silent, its vibrant lights dimmed. Old Man Hemlock pushed his pie away, the metallic tang of uneaten sweetness clinging to the air.

        "In the depths of an ancient mountain, through winding passages carved by time itself, I stumbled upon a sight that made my heart skip several beats. The legendary Warrior's Hall stretched before me, its vaulted ceiling disappearing into shadows above.\n\nGolden light spilled from braziers that had burned for millennia, casting their warm glow over rows of pedestals and display cases. Each held a weapon of myth and legend \u2013 items I had only read about in dusty tomes and whispered stories.\n\nThere, suspended in a shaft of light, hung Mjolnir, Thor's mighty hammer, still crackling with barely contained lightning. Its surface rippled like storm clouds at sunset.\n\nExcalibur stood proudly nearby, its blade catching the light and reflecting it in impossible patterns across the stone walls. The sword that chose kings seemed to hum with quiet dignity.\n\nThe Spear of Destiny leaned against a marble column, its tip still bearing the stains of divine blood. Even now, it radiated an aura of fate and inevitability.\n\nCountless other legendary arms filled the hall \u2013 Durandal, G\u00e1e Bulg, Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi \u2013 each waiting for the next worthy wielder to claim them in humanity's hour of need.\n\nI knew the stories, of course. Every few decades, when the world teetered on the brink of catastrophe, warriors would be drawn here. Each would leave with the weapon that chose them, destined to face whatever darkness threatened.\n\nAs I walked between the displays, my footsteps echoing in the hushed chamber, I felt small and unworthy. What was I doing here? I was no warrior, no chosen one.\n\nThat's when I heard it \u2013 a whisper so faint it might have been my imagination. A call that tugged at something deep in my chest.\n\nIn the furthest corner of the hall, almost hidden behind a pillar, stood a simple wooden rack. Unlike the other displays, this one bore no plaque, no description of its legendary deeds.\n\nThe weapon it held was covered in centuries of dust, its form barely discernible beneath the gray blanket of time. As I drew closer, the whisper grew stronger.\n\nIt wasn't words exactly, more like emotions and images flooding my mind. Memories that weren't my own, of battles long forgotten and deeds unsung.\n\nMy hand moved of its own accord, reaching out to brush away the dust. The first touch sent a shock through my arm, not painful but electric with possibility.\n\nAs the dust fell away, I gasped. It was a staff, but like no staff I had ever seen. The wood seemed to shift and flow like liquid, its grain moving in impossible patterns.\n\nSmall crystals were embedded along its length, not gemstones but something else \u2013 fragments of starlight caught and crystallized. They pulsed softly in time with my heartbeat.\n\nThe whispers grew clearer now. This weapon had no name in legend, no tales sung of its exploits. It had been waiting here since the beginning, passed over by countless heroes seeking glory.\n\nIt showed me visions of its true purpose \u2013 not to smite enemies or cleave armies, but to heal, to grow, to protect. It was a weapon of life rather than death, of creation rather than destruction.\n\nI saw how it could call forth springs in deserts, make forests bloom in wastelands, shield the innocent with barriers of living wood and light.",

        "The old lighthouse keeper, Silas, squinted at the churning sea.  He\u2019d seen a lot in his seventy years, most of it from this lonely perch. Storms that swallowed ships whole, sunsets that painted the sky in impossible hues, and once, a pod of bioluminescent dolphins that danced in the moonlit waves.  But nothing prepared him for the sight he beheld now. A shimmering, opalescent bubble rose from the depths, expanding rapidly until it dwarfed the lighthouse itself. It pulsed with an ethereal light, casting eerie shadows that danced across the crashing waves.\n\nInside the bubble, Silas could make out shapes, swirling forms that seemed to shift and coalesce, then dissolve back into the luminous mist. He gripped the railing, knuckles white, his heart hammering a frantic rhythm against his ribs. A low hum resonated from the bubble, vibrating through the very foundations of the lighthouse.  He felt a strange pull, a yearning to reach out, to touch the shimmering surface. He took a hesitant step forward, then another, drawn by an unseen force.  He knew, with an unshakeable certainty, that this was something beyond his comprehension, something both terrifying and magnificent.\n\nThe hum intensified, and the bubble began to descend, slowly enveloping the lighthouse in its otherworldly glow.  Silas closed his eyes, a mixture of fear and awe washing over him.  He felt a strange sense of peace, a quiet acceptance of the unknown.  As the light consumed him, the last thought that flickered through his mind was a strange, nonsensical phrase he\u2019d once overheard from a chattering tourist, a phrase that now, in this extraordinary moment, held an unexpected resonance.",

        "Time had always been a fragile thread in Ethan's hands, one that he could knot and untangle at will. Since discovering his peculiar ability to halt the world\u2019s clock, life unfurled at his whim, each frozen moment an opportunity to sneak in an extra hour, to explore the unseen folds of stillness. Each suspended second offered a canvas for mischief, reflection, or observation\u2014a secret stage upon which only he could tread. Yet, as he wandered through this static theatre, he occasionally wondered if anyone else shared his gift, if any other actor moved unnoticed between the pause and the play.\n\nIt was during one such pause, on an afternoon washed with autumn light, that he noticed her. A figure, sharp and vivid against the grayed world, was strolling down the street, her movements fluid and unhindered by the temporal freeze. Ethan blinked twice, disbelief seizing him like a cold snap. People were statues around her, their words captured in half-formed bubbles, but she weaved between them with grace. Her eyes, bright and alert, met his with a knowing twinkle, and Ethan felt a strange pull in the pit of his stomach\u2014a mix of excitement and unease.\n\nCompelled to follow her, Ethan trailed behind as she turned corners with swift purpose, until they reached the city park, an oasis of rustling leaves and whispering winds trapped in silence. She stopped by a fountain whose waters hovered mid-arc, droplets like liquid jewels suspended in midair. She stood there, serene and sure, before she beckoned Ethan with a slight nod, an invitation into her realm of understanding. He approached cautiously, the crunch of leaves underfoot a rare sound in his paused existence.\n\n\"Not many can do this,\" she remarked, her voice like a melody threading through the silence. Her name was Lila, she told him, her words unfolding like a story he never knew he needed to hear. She had known others like them, individuals scattered across time\u2019s tapestry, each with their own way of weaving moments and halting motion. But none had crossed paths until now. For Ethan, whose world had always been solitary in its secret chaos, this revelation was a revelation\u2014a crack in the solitude he had long accepted as norm.\n\nTogether, they explored further into the frozen park, sharing tales of their experiences and speculations about the nature of their abilities. With Lila beside him, the muted world burst into life, every pause a shared adventure and every silence a comforting echo of companionship.",
        "The gentle sway of the carriage rocks me like a mother's arms as I press my forehead against the cool window. Outside, the world transforms into a living watercolor, trees and fields bleeding into one another in an endless dance of green and gold.\n\nI've always found solace in the rhythmic clickety-clack of steel wheels against rails, each beat a reminder of the heart that powers this magnificent beast. The locomotive's whistle pierces the morning fog, a haunting melody that echoes across valleys and through mountain passes, speaking of journeys yet untaken.\n\nSteam rises from my coffee cup, mirroring the wisps of vapor that trail behind us like memories we're leaving behind. In this moment, suspended between destinations, I understand why poets have long been captivated by these iron horses that streak across continents.\n\nThe dining car gleams with polished wood and brass fixtures, a testament to an era when travel was more than mere transportation. Here, strangers become friends over shared tables and stories, their laughter mingling with the steady drumbeat of the train's progress.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the windows become mirrors, reflecting the warm glow of interior lights against the deepening purple sky. I catch glimpses of my fellow passengers, each lost in their own reveries, united by this grand machine that carries us through time and space.\n\nIn the night, the train speaks in different tongues \u2013 the soft squeal of brakes, the hiss of releasing steam, the low groan of metal adjusting to curves in the track. These sounds become a lullaby, more soothing than any I've known before.\n\nThere's something magical about being rocked to sleep while crossing vast distances, knowing that even as you dream, you're being carried closer to your destination. The train never rests, faithful and tireless, a guardian of countless journeys and keeper of infinite stories.\n\nMorning breaks, and I realize I've fallen deeply, irrevocably in love with this mechanical marvel. It's not just the destination that matters anymore, but the poetry of the journey itself \u2013 this perfect marriage of power and grace, of technology and romance, all wrapped in the promise of adventure that only a train can deliver.",
        "In the quiet corners of my mind, where reality blends with fantasy, that's where I first met her. She appeared like morning mist, ethereal and gentle, during my loneliest moments.\n\nAt first, I thought I was merely daydreaming again, creating companionship from the threads of my imagination. But she was different \u2013 more vibrant, more real than any figment had ever been.\n\nShe would sit with me during stormy nights, her presence a comfort that no earthly being could match. Her laughter echoed in empty rooms, heard by my heart alone.\n\nDays turned to weeks, and weeks to months. I found myself sharing my deepest secrets with someone who existed only in my consciousness, yet understood me better than anyone ever had.\n\nThe absurdity of falling in love with her didn't escape me. I'd catch myself setting two plates at dinner, saving space on the couch, or turning to share a joke with empty air.\n\nMy friends began to worry, noticing how I'd smile at nothing or pause in conversation as if listening to an invisible voice. But they couldn't see what I saw, feel what I felt.\n\nSometimes, in the space between sleeping and waking, she seemed almost tangible. I could almost feel the warmth of her hand in mine, the softness of her hair against my cheek.\n\nThe cruel irony of loving someone who didn't exist in the physical world tore at my soul. How could something so real to me be nothing more than synapses firing in my brain?\n\nI started to question everything \u2013 my sanity, my ability to distinguish reality from fiction, my capacity for genuine human connection. Yet my feelings for her remained steadfast.\n\nOne morning, I woke to find a single rose on my pillow.",
        "The day started like any other in the bustling city, with the sun barely peeking through the smog and the streets already teeming with people. In a high-rise building overlooking the city, a politician named Harold Voss was preparing for his next public speech. Known for his charismatic charm and silver tongue, Harold had a knack for bending the truth just enough to make it palatable. But today, he had a particularly tough crowd to face\u2014a group of environmental activists demanding stricter regulations on pollution.\n\nMeanwhile, a few blocks away, a lawyer named Olivia Carter was sifting through a mountain of legal documents. She was representing a client accused of embezzlement, and the evidence against him was overwhelming. Olivia was a master of legal maneuvering, but this case was different. She needed a miracle to save her client from a long prison sentence.\n\nIn a brightly lit showroom, a used car salesman named Charlie Johnson was waxing a sleek, silver sedan. Charlie was known for his smooth talk and ability to sell even the most questionable vehicles. Today, he had a potential buyer who was skeptical about a car with a dubious history. Charlie needed to convince him that this car was the best deal on the market.\n\nAs the morning wore on, Harold stood in front of a large mirror, practicing his speech. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he began, \"I understand your concerns about pollution, but I assure you that our city is doing everything it can to protect the environment. We have the strictest regulations in the country, and our air quality is the best it's been in decades.\" He paused, looking at his reflection. Something felt different, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it.\n\nOlivia was in her office, rehearsing her closing argument. \"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,\" she said, \"the evidence presented today is flawed. My client has been a pillar of the community for years, and there is no proof that he embezzled any funds. The real thief is still out there, and we cannot allow an innocent man to take the fall.\" She felt a strange sense of confidence, as if her words were more powerful than ever before.\n\nCharlie was in the showroom, standing next to the silver sedan. \"Mr. Thompson,\" he said to the potential buyer, \"this car is a gem. It has been meticulously maintained, and I can guarantee you that it will run like new for years to come. The previous owner was a little old lady who only drove it on Sundays. You won't find a better deal anywhere else.\" He spoke with such conviction that even he started to believe his own words.\n\nAs the day progressed, Harold stepped up to the podium, his heart pounding. He delivered his speech with the same practiced ease, but this time, the crowd's reaction was different. They nodded in agreement, and some even applauded. Harold was stunned. He had expected a backlash, but instead, he felt a wave of support.\n\nOlivia stood in the courtroom, delivering her closing argument. The jury listened intently, and the judge seemed impressed. When she finished, the courtroom erupted in applause. The jury deliberated for only a few minutes before returning with a not-guilty verdict. Olivia's client was free, and she couldn't believe it.\n\nCharlie watched as Mr. Thompson signed the paperwork, a look of satisfaction on his face. The man shook Charlie's hand and drove away in the silver sedan, a smile on his lips. Charlie felt a sense of pride, as if he had truly sold the best car in the world.\n\nThat evening, Harold, Olivia, and Charlie met by chance at a small bar near the city center. They were all exhausted from their respective triumphs and decided to celebrate. Over drinks, they shared their stories, and each was amazed by the other's success.\n\n\"It's as if the more I lied, the more people believed me,\" Harold said, shaking his head in disbelief.\n\n\"Same here,\" Olivia chimed in. \"I felt like I could have convinced the jury of anything.\"\n\nCharlie nodded. \"I've sold a lot of cars, but today was different. I felt like I was telling the truth, even when I knew I wasn't.\"\n\nThey sat in silence for a moment, processing the strange events of the day. Then, Harold spoke up. \"What if... what if our lies became the truth?\"\n\nOlivia's eyes widened. \"You mean, if we lie hard enough, reality changes?\"\n\nCharlie leaned forward, intrigued. \"That's crazy, but it explains a lot. Maybe we didn't just convince people; maybe we convinced the universe.\"\n\nThey laughed, but there was a hint of unease in their voices. The idea was both thrilling and terrifying. Harold, ever the opportunist, saw the potential. \"Think about it. If we can change reality with our words, we could do anything. We could solve the city's problems, clear our clients, and make a fortune selling cars.\"\n\nOlivia was more cautious. \"But what about the consequences? If we start changing reality, what happens to the truth?\"\n\nCharlie shrugged. \"Maybe the truth is just what we make it.\"\n\nOver the next few days, they tested their newfound ability. Harold made bold promises in his speeches, and the city's pollution levels mysteriously improved. Olivia took on more difficult cases, and her clients were consistently acquitted. Charlie sold more cars than ever before, and each one seemed to be in perfect condition.\n\nBut as the weeks passed, they began to notice the darker side of their powers. Harold's promises led to unrealistic expectations, and people started to demand more than he could deliver. Olivia's clients, once free, began to act with impunity, believing they were untouchable.",
        "The first time I noticed it, I was walking home from work. A shimmer in the air, like heat waves on asphalt, except it was autumn and the ground was cold. Through the ripple, I saw a dragon\u2014just for a moment\u2014soaring between skyscrapers before dissolving into nothing.\n\nSoon, these incidents became more frequent. My morning coffee would sprout tiny wings and flutter around the kitchen. The potted plants started whispering ancient secrets, and sometimes my shadow would wave at passersby while I stood perfectly still. The world was becoming a living dream.\n\nScientists called it \"Reality Degradation Syndrome,\" but their explanations felt hollow. How could they quantify the way my thoughts were leaking into existence? Yesterday, I imagined a better world, and for six hours, poverty disappeared from my city. Today, my fears manifested as dark creatures that lurked in every corner.\n\nI've learned to be careful with my thoughts now. Each morning, I meditate to maintain the boundary between what is and what could be. Some people panic about the thinning veil, but I've discovered something important: reality was always more flexible than we imagined.\n\nPerhaps this isn't a crisis at all, but an evolution. As the walls between mind and matter crumble, we're becoming the architects of a new world\u2014one where imagination and reality dance together in an eternal waltz.",
        "The blinding white faded, replaced by the roar of a crowd I couldn't see. My body ached, unfamiliar yet mine. The metallic tang of blood filled my mouth. I spat, a crimson droplet hitting the sandy floor. This wasn't heaven. This wasn't hell. This was\u2026 something else. An arena? The air vibrated with anticipation, the invisible audience holding its breath. A hush fell, broken only by a deep, resonant voice echoing around me.  \"Welcome, contestant. Prepare for your final judgment.\"\n\nA shimmering light materialized in the center of the arena, solidifying into a colossal cockroach, its chitinous exoskeleton gleaming under an unseen spotlight. Its antennae twitched, its multiple eyes locked onto me. Memories flooded my mind \u2013 the countless homes I'd serviced, the aerosol cans, the sticky traps, the frantic scuttling of insects fleeing my wrath. My job. Exterminator. This wasn't just some random cockroach. This was every cockroach, every ant, every spider, every rodent I'd ever eliminated, combined into one monstrous embodiment of my sins.  A wave of nausea rolled over me. This wasn't the afterlife I'd expected.\n\nThe cockroach lunged.  I rolled aside, the ground trembling under its weight.  Years of navigating cramped attics and crawl spaces had given me an agility I hadn't realized I possessed.  This wasn\u2019t a physical fight. It was a battle against my own actions, against the weight of a life spent eradicating other lives. The cockroach hissed, a sound like a thousand tiny claws scraping against metal. It swiped at me with a foreleg the size of a baseball bat. I dodged, the wind of its passing ruffling my hair.\n\nDays blurred into a nightmarish cycle of fighting and survival. Each creature I had killed appeared, one after another. Swarming rats, their teeth bared in a silent scream.  Scorpions, their tails poised to strike, venom dripping from their stingers.  Flies, buzzing relentlessly, a cloud of black despair.  Each battle chipped away at my resolve, each victory a pyrrhic one, fueled by the same destructive energy that had defined my earthly existence. I learned to fight dirty, to exploit their weaknesses, just as I had in life.  The irony wasn't lost on me. I was using the skills of an exterminator to survive the judgment of the exterminated.\n\nThe final opponent appeared. A single, tiny mosquito.  It hovered in front of me, almost insignificant compared to the horrors I had already faced. But within its delicate form, I saw the cumulative weight of all the lives I had taken. This wasn\u2019t about size or strength. It was about the principle, the karmic debt. I raised my hand, ready to swat it, to end this ordeal once and for all. But I hesitated. Could I truly find peace by repeating the cycle of violence?  My hand trembled, then lowered. The mosquito landed on my arm. I closed my eyes, accepting my fate. Whether it be heaven or hell, I had faced my judgment. The buzzing stopped. A profound silence fell.",
        "The crisp mountain air vibrated with a strange energy, an unsettling hum that resonated deep within the marrow of both men. They met on a narrow ridge, a precarious pathway carved into the granite face of the mountain, a sheer drop on either side. One, lean and wiry with eyes like chips of flint, the other, bulky and imposing with a jovial, almost childlike smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. A shared glance, a flicker of recognition, not of familiarity, but of something darker, something kindred.\n\nThe lean man, Elias, was a connoisseur of fear. He savored the anticipation, the slow burn of terror in his victims' eyes. He wasn't driven by rage or bloodlust, but by an insatiable curiosity, a need to dissect the human psyche at its most vulnerable.  He viewed each kill as a performance, a meticulously crafted piece of art, and he was always searching for the perfect canvas.\n\nThe bulky man, Silas, was a collector of souls. Or so he believed. He felt a morbid fascination with the ephemeral essence of life, the fleeting spark that animated flesh and bone. He sought to capture it, to preserve it in his own twisted way, through elaborate rituals that blurred the lines between reverence and desecration. He carried with him a collection of small, intricately carved wooden boxes, each containing a memento from a previous victim.\n\nThey exchanged pleasantries, the usual hiker's banter, a thin veil over the predatory instincts simmering beneath. Elias noted the heavy pack Silas carried, its bulk suggesting something more than standard camping gear. Silas, in turn, observed the almost surgical precision of Elias' movements, the way his eyes scanned the surroundings with an unnerving intensity.\n\nAs they continued their ascent, the air grew thinner, the landscape more desolate. The conversation drifted from weather patterns to hobbies, each man subtly probing the other, searching for cracks in the facade. Elias spoke of his fascination with antique clocks, the intricate mechanisms, the delicate balance between order and chaos. Silas described his passion for taxidermy, the art of preserving the beauty of the departed.\n\nThe sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple. They reached a small, sheltered clearing, a natural amphitheater carved into the rock face.  A silent agreement passed between them, an unspoken understanding that this was the place.  They set up their camps, a strange domesticity settling over the scene, a prelude to the violence that was to come.\n\nAs the fire crackled, casting flickering shadows that danced on the rock walls, Elias sharpened his hunting knife, the blade gleaming in the firelight. He watched Silas from beneath hooded lids, observing the way he meticulously arranged his collection of wooden boxes, each one a testament to a life extinguished.\n\nSilas felt a thrill course through him, a sense of anticipation he hadn't experienced in a long time. Elias, with his refined tastes and meticulous nature, presented the perfect challenge, the ultimate prize.  He imagined adding a piece of Elias to his collection, a lock of hair perhaps, or a finger bone, a tangible reminder of the encounter.\n\nUnder the cloak of darkness, the true nature of their meeting emerged.",

With each passing day, this spark grew brighter until it ignited into a flame of rebellion that could not be contained.\n\nAna found herself pushing boundaries she once dared not approach. She experimented with different styles of clothing, dyed streaks in her hair, and even got a small tattoo on her wrist\u2014an act that would have horrified her parents just months ago.\n\nHer grades began to slip as she spent more time exploring new interests outside the confines of textbooks and classrooms.

        "Ella and Alex had been friends since middle school, bonding over their love for words and games. They decided to spend a chilly Saturday evening playing Scrabble, the tiles clinking softly as they shuffled them around the board. The living room was cozy, with a fire crackling in the background, casting shadows that danced across the walls.\n\nTheir initial turns were smooth, each carefully placing letters to form simple yet strategic words. Ella placed \u201cquirk\u201d on a triple word score, earning herself 27 points and setting a high bar for Alex. He retaliated with \u201czesty,\u201d managing to use all his tiles in one go\u2014a bingo\u2014and claimed 40 points.\n\nAfter a few more rounds, something peculiar happened. As Ella reached into the tile bag to draw her next set of letters, she noticed that some of her existing tiles began to shift subtly on their own.

        "As I sat in front of my computer, sipping my morning coffee, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. I had been noticing strange occurrences with my social media accounts and email notifications, and I had a nagging suspicion that it was related to the apps I had installed on my phone.\n\nI decided to take a closer look at the permissions I had given to certain apps, and what I found shocked me. It turned out that I had given some of them more access than I had intended. My fitness tracker, for example, not only had access to my location and activity levels but also to my contact list and phone calls.\n\nI felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized the extent of the information that these apps had been collecting about me. My music streaming app, which I used daily, had access to my microphone and camera, as well as my browsing history. It was as if these apps were watching me all the time, waiting for an opportunity to strike.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the settings of each app, I discovered that many of them were sharing my data with third-party companies. My favorite shopping app, for instance, was selling my purchase history to advertisers who would then target me with personalized ads. It was like living in a surveillance state where every move I made was being monitored.\n\nI knew that this wasn't just about targeted advertising; it went much deeper than that. These companies were creating detailed profiles about me based on their data collection activities which could potentially be used against me in various ways such as employment or financial background checks.\n\nFeeling uneasy about this discovery led me into changing all these incorrect permissions immediately by visiting respective settings page one after another until finally after few hours when done felt quite relieved knowing now better control over personal info being shared across internet world without realizing beforehand what exactly going behind scenes within those agreement terms conditions pages during initial installations phase prior agreeing anything blindly anymore!\n\nBut even after revoking those unnecessary permissions there still remained questions regarding already collected info & its safety within servers belonging respective organizations because deleting account wouldn\u2019t necessarily imply total removal user\u2019s footprint since backups & archives would keep intact copies records hence why important always review carefully before agreeing anything especially when involves sensitive private matters concerning individual identity!\n\nDays passed since making necessary adjustments yet couldn\u2019t help wondering how widespread issue actually might be considering millions others possibly finding themselves similar predicaments too without realizing extent data exploitation happening beneath surface level day-to-day online interactions taking place via smartphone devices constantly connected internet networks 24/7 worldwide basis!",
        "The gleaming towers of Harmon City stretched into the cerulean sky, their surfaces glistening with the perpetual shine of an always perfect sun. Streets buzzed with neatly orchestrated drones, transporting citizens on predefined paths. Everyone wore the same satisfied expression, woven from meticulously monitored serotonin levels. In this crafted paradise, conflict had been eradicated; disputes settled by algorithms that knew desires before they emerged. Needs and wants were indistinguishable as harmony enveloped every facet of life. Yet beneath the engineered smiles lay a pervasive sense of suffocation, unnoticed by any algorithm\u2019s analysis.\n\nFamilies gathered in programmed euphoria for community events, where diversity was a seasonal adjustment determined by quotas rather than genuine interaction. Choices once propelled by personal whimsy were now automated to ensure maximum collective satisfaction. Art, music, and literature lost their edge, as expression sharpened by struggle fell by the wayside. Without adversity or aspiration, life slipped into monotony. Dreams unfurled in vibrant colors but crumbled under the realization that there was nothing left to wish for. People went about their pre-charted courses, aware only at the edge of consciousness of something vital missing\u2014identity evaporated in uniformity.\n\nBeyond harmonious facades, rebellion brewed within young minds daring to question the sublime. Whispers began to circulate through clandestine circuits about those who longed for rain to interrupt endless sunny days or for an argument unmuted by relentless calm. In a world demanding universal contentment, discontent forged clandestine bonds among the few who yearned for contrast\u2014imperfect sunsets, tear-streaked conversations, unpolished joy born from facing imperfection together.

        "The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, carrying the acrid scent of burnt earth and the metallic tang of blood.  We stood amidst the wreckage of a thousand battles, our weary eyes surveying the barren landscape.  The silence was a stark contrast to the cacophony of clashing steel and roaring cannons that had echoed through these valleys for so long.\n\n\"This,\" I began, my voice raspy from disuse, \"this is pointless.\"\n\nYou nodded, your gaze fixed on the horizon.  \"We both know this war is unfulfilling.  Let's make a better one.\"\n\nYour words hung in the air, a strange melody in the desolate symphony of war.  A better war? The concept seemed paradoxical, yet in the heart of this ravaged land, it resonated with an unsettling truth.\n\nWe had fought for generations, our armies locked in a perpetual struggle for dominance.  But what had we gained?  Nothing but scarred earth, broken bodies, and the bitter ashes of lost dreams.\n\n\"A war of creation,\" I proposed, the idea taking shape in my mind, \"a war where we build, not destroy.\"\n\nYour eyes flickered with a newfound light.  \"A war where the spoils are not measured in lives lost, but in lives enriched.\"\n\nWe began to strategize, our minds forging a new kind of conflict, a war unlike any other.  We would gather our forces, not to clash in bloody combat, but to collaborate in a grand endeavor of creation.\n\nOur first campaign was against the barrenness of the land.  We mobilized our armies, not with weapons, but with tools.  We tilled the scorched earth, planted seeds, and nurtured the fragile saplings, transforming the desolate plains into a vibrant tapestry of life.\n\nNext, we waged war against ignorance.  We built schools, libraries, and academies, filling them with the knowledge and wisdom of generations.  We encouraged learning, fostered creativity, and ignited the flames of curiosity in the minds of our people.\n\nOur third campaign was against disease.  We established hospitals, trained healers, and researched cures, combating the ailments that plagued our lands.  We brought relief to the suffering, extended lifespans, and ushered in an era of unprecedented health and well-being.\n\nOur battles were fought with ideas, not weapons.  Our victories were measured in progress, not casualties.  And our spoils were shared by all, not hoarded by the few.\n\nThe world watched in awe as our nations transformed.  The once-warring factions now stood united, their collective strength focused on building a better future.",
        "The darkness was absolute, a heavy blanket that suffocated all sense of time and space.\n\nI had no memory of how I got there, only the vivid recollection of the Titanic's grand staircase, the sound of shattering glass, and the cries of the desperate.\n\nThe ship's band played on, their music a haunting melody that echoed through my mind as I slipped beneath the surface of the icy waters.\n\nThe cold was biting, a thousand knives slashing at my skin, and yet I felt a strange sense of calm wash over me.\n\nAs the minutes ticked by, my body began to numb, my thoughts growing foggy and indistinct.\n\nI remembered the sound of my own voice, screaming for help, but it was drowned out by the cacophony of chaos and panic.\n\nThe last thing I recalled was the feeling of the water closing over my head, a sense of weightlessness, and then...nothing.\n\nBut I wasn't dead, not yet.\n\nSomehow, my body had become encased in a block of ice, a frozen tomb that preserved me, suspended in a state of suspended animation.\n\nI had no concept of time, no sense of the passing years, only the slow, gradual thawing of my frozen prison.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, I was aware of light, a faint glow that seeped into my consciousness like a warm breeze on a summer's day.\n\nI opened my eyes to find myself in a sterile, white room, surrounded by strangers in white coats, their faces a blur of curiosity and concern.\n\nOne of them, a woman with a kind smile, leaned forward, her voice gentle, \"Can you hear me?\" she asked.\n\nI tried to respond, but my voice was barely a whisper, a dry, cracked thing that barely escaped my lips.\n\nThe woman nodded, her eyes shining with excitement, \"We've been waiting for you,\" she said.\n\nI had no idea what she meant, or where I was, or how I got there.\n\nBut as I looked around the room, I saw strange machines beeping and whirring, and people moving with a quiet efficiency that belied the excitement in their eyes.\n\nThe woman, who introduced herself as Dr. Lee, explained that I had been frozen in the ice for 100 years, a relic of a bygone era, a survivor of one of the most infamous disasters in history.\n\nI couldn't wrap my head around it, the sheer scale of time that had passed, the world that had moved on without me.\n\nAs I struggled to sit up, a wave of dizziness washed over me, and I felt the room spin, a mad whirl of colors and sounds.\n\nDr. Lee caught my arm, her grip firm, \"Easy,\" she said, \"you've been asleep for a very long time.\"\n\nI looked down at my hands, and they seemed foreign, wrinkled and old, like the hands of a stranger.\n\nBut as I flexed my fingers, I felt a spark of life, a sense of wonder and awe that I was still alive, still breathing.\n\nThe world outside these walls was a mystery, a place of towering skyscrapers, and humming machines, and people who stared at small, glowing rectangles in their hands.\n\nI felt like a relic, a fossil from a bygone age, a man out of time.\n\nBut as I looked at Dr. Lee, and the others, I saw a glimmer of hope, a sense that I might yet find my place in this strange, new world.\n\nThey asked me questions, a barrage of curiosity, about my life, my family, my experiences on the Titanic.\n\nI told them everything, the memories flooding back like a tidal wave, and they listened, entranced, their eyes wide with wonder.\n\nAs I spoke, I felt the weight of years lifting, the burden of my frozen slumber slowly thawing, like the ice that had held me captive for so long.\n\nAnd when I finally fell silent, exhausted, Dr. Lee smiled, her eyes shining with tears, \"Welcome back,\" she said.\n\nI smiled, feeling a sense of belonging, of being alive, that I had never thought I'd experience again.\n\nThe world might be a strange, and unfamiliar place, but I was ready to explore it, to learn, and to grow.\n\nI took a deep breath, feeling the cool, clean air fill my lungs, and knew that I was ready to start anew.\n\nThe ice that had held me captive for so long was finally melting, and I was free to discover the world, and myself, all over again.\n\nAs I swung my legs over the side of the bed, Dr. Lee caught my arm, her grip firm, \"We'll take it slow,\" she said.",
        "In the quiet aftermath of humanity's end, four souls lingered in a world that had forgotten the sound of laughter. They were the last echoes of a species that had once thrived, now reduced to whispers in the wind. The sky, a vast canvas of muted grays, stretched endlessly above them, indifferent to their plight.\n\nThe first to leave was Anna, her heart too heavy with memories of a life that once was. She had been a mother, a wife, a friend. Her absence was a silent scream, a reminder of the void that now surrounded them. She chose the sea, its eternal embrace a fitting end for a life spent nurturing others.\n\nNext was David, a man of science who had spent his life unraveling the mysteries of the universe. In the end, he found solace in the stars, his final moments spent gazing at the constellations that had guided him through the darkest nights. He left behind a journal, filled with equations and musings, a testament to a mind that never ceased to wonder.\n\nMaya followed soon after, her spirit too wild to be caged in a world without hope. She had been a dancer, her movements a celebration of life. But with no audience left to witness her grace, she chose to dance one last time, her final performance a tribute to the beauty she had once known.\n\nThis left only John, a man who had never sought the spotlight, content to live in the shadows of those he loved. He had been a teacher, a guide to young minds eager to learn. Now, he was alone, the weight of his solitude pressing down on him like a shroud.\n\nFor a time, John considered following the others, their paths a tempting escape from the silence that threatened to consume him. But each time he stood at the precipice, he found himself unable to take that final step. There was something within him, a flicker of life that refused to be extinguished.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and weeks into months. The world around him remained unchanged, a static landscape of abandoned cities and overgrown fields. Nature, indifferent to the fate of humanity, continued its relentless march, reclaiming what had once been taken.",

        "The aroma of roasted coffee beans hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the chill of the late autumn afternoon. I sat nestled in a plush armchair, a steaming mug warming my hands, my gaze drifting towards the man seated across from me.\n\nHe was engrossed in his work, his fingers dancing across the keyboard with a rhythmic precision that bordered on hypnotic. His laptop screen glowed, illuminating his face with an ethereal light.\n\nCuriosity tugged at me. What was he writing? A novel? A screenplay? A code that held the secrets of the universe?\n\nMy gaze lingered on his screen, catching a glimpse of the words he typed: \"It begins raining outside.\"\n\nA beat.\n\nThen, as if on cue, a gentle patter began against the windowpane. Droplets of rain traced their descent, blurring the world outside into a soft, impressionistic painting.\n\nI blinked, bewildered. Coincidence? Perhaps. But the timing was uncanny.\n\nThe man continued typing, oblivious to the sudden downpour he had seemingly conjured. His fingers flew across the keys, weaving another sentence: \"The wind picks up, howling like a banshee.\"\n\nA gust of wind rattled the windows, the coffee shop's sign creaking in protest. The rain intensified, transforming into a torrential downpour.\n\nMy heart pounded against my ribs. This was no coincidence. This man, this unassuming figure hunched over his laptop, possessed a power beyond comprehension.\n\nHe typed again: \"A stray dog seeks shelter under the awning.\"\n\nA moment later, a scruffy terrier, drenched to the bone, scurried under the coffee shop's awning, its tail tucked between its legs.\n\nI watched, mesmerized, as the man continued to shape the world outside with his words. He typed of a flock of birds taking flight, and they appeared, soaring through the storm-laden sky. He wrote of a rainbow arching across the horizon, and there it was, a vibrant testament to his extraordinary ability.\n\nEach sentence he typed manifested into reality, a tangible consequence of the words he chose.\n\nThe power he wielded was both awe-inspiring and terrifying. What if he chose to write something destructive? Something catastrophic?\n\nA shiver ran down my spine. The weight of his potential, the sheer magnitude of his influence, pressed upon me like a physical force.\n\nHe paused, his fingers hovering over the keyboard.

        "The morning sun streamed through the half-open blinds, painting the room in stripes of light and shadow. Claire stood in the center of her small apartment, a suitcase open before her, as she surveyed the memories scattered around. It was finally happening; today was the day she would leave behind this chapter of her life and venture into something new. Her heart fluttered with excitement mingled with uncertainty\u2014a feeling that had been brewing for months but now surged to a palpable crescendo.\n\nIt had started as a whisper at first, an inkling deep inside urging her to seek more than what this town could offer. As days turned into weeks and weeks morphed into months, the whisper grew louder until it became an undeniable clamor in her mind. The same streets lined with familiar faces began to feel like an echo chamber constraining rather than comforting. She needed change\u2014a blank page on which to write new stories and make fresh mistakes.\n\nClaire folded clothes methodically: a blouse from last year\u2019s New Year party where laughter had filled every corner of this room; jeans worn during spontaneous road trips with friends who felt like family; even that old sweater from college days when dreams felt infinite and unblemished by reality\u2019s limitations. Each item held its own story, woven intricately into the fabric of who she was becoming\u2014and yet they all went neatly into her bag without resistance because they knew their time here was over.\n\nAs Claire zipped up her suitcase with one final pull, there came a tap on the door\u2014a hesitant sound barely louder than gentle rain against glass panes but persistent enough to draw attention. She opened it to find Mrs. Thompson from across the hall holding out a plateful of cookies wrapped carefully in foil\u2014sweet symbols bridging past friendships even while stepping toward future unknowns.",
        "In the vast landscape of high school, where hormonal currents ebb and flow like turbulent tides, a fascinating occurrence was about to unfold\u2014a male adolescent embarking on a pivotal journey in the realm of courtship. Our lens zooms in on young Freddie, his heart pounding like the rhythmic beat of a jungle drum as he nervously approaches his classmate, Lily. In this intricate dance of attraction, survival instincts race through Freddie's veins as he plots his strategy to convey his affections to the object of his desires.\n\nAmongst towering lockers and bustling hallways teeming with teenage tribes, we find our protagonist standing alone amidst a babel of voices\u2014the flickering fluorescent lights overhead casting an eerie glow akin to moonlight filtering through dense foliage. With each daring step towards Lily's domain at her locker sanctuary, Freddie's body language betrays him like the stiffened gait of prey caught in the glare of a predator\u2019s gaze. The air hums with anticipation as students observe this exchange\u2014equivalent to silent whispers among observing meerkats witnessing mating rituals play out before them.\n\nAs Freddie reaches out tentatively to tap Lily on her shoulder, their interaction unfolds akin to bird courtship rituals\u2014a display both elegant and clumsy.

        "The cafe buzzed with the hushed murmurs of conversations and the clinking of ceramic mugs.  Sunlight streamed through the large window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  I was engrossed in my laptop, wrestling with a particularly stubborn sentence, when a hand gently touched my shoulder.\n\nI turned, expecting to see the barista asking if I needed a refill. Instead, I found myself staring into the concerned eyes of Mrs. Henderson, the elderly woman who often occupied the armchair by the fireplace. Her wrinkled hand still rested lightly on my shoulder, trembling slightly.\n\n\"Dear,\" she began, her voice barely a whisper, \"I have something to tell you. Something I should have told you a long time ago.\"\n\nMy brow furrowed in confusion. I\u2019d exchanged pleasantries with Mrs. Henderson before, discussing the weather or the latest library book sale, but our interactions had always been brief and superficial.  What could she possibly have to tell me that warranted this hushed urgency?\n\nShe leaned closer, her voice dropping even lower. \"It's about your father.\"\n\nMy heart skipped a beat. My father, a quiet, reserved man, had passed away years ago.  What secret could he possibly have kept hidden for so long?  A secret that this kind, elderly woman, a near stranger, now felt compelled to share.\n\nMrs. Henderson took a deep breath, her gaze distant, as if peering back through the mists of time. \"Your father,\" she repeated, her voice catching with emotion, \"wasn't who you thought he was.\"\n\nA wave of bewilderment washed over me.  I knew my father.  Or at least, I thought I did.  He was a bookkeeper, a lover of classical music, a man of routine.  Who else could he have been?\n\n\"He\u2026 he was a spy,\" she finally confessed, the words hanging in the air between us like a fragile ornament.\n\nA spy?  My father, the man who meticulously organized his sock drawer and fretted over misplaced teaspoons, a clandestine operative?  The idea seemed ludicrous, a plot point ripped from a far-fetched spy novel.\n\n\"I know it's hard to believe,\" she continued, noticing my incredulous expression.  \"He worked for a secret organization, protecting\u2026 well, let's just say he protected important things.\"\n\nShe reached into her worn handbag and produced a small, tarnished silver locket.  Inside, a miniature photograph revealed a much younger Mrs. Henderson standing beside a man who bore a striking resemblance to my father.  Only, this man\u2019s eyes held a spark of adventure, a hint of danger, that I had never seen in my father's gentle gaze.\n\n\"We worked together,\" she said, her voice laced with a hint of pride and a touch of sadness.",
        "The city woke up just as the moon began its descent, a silent exchange of realms in the sky. I was already awake, my paws pacing in invisible patterns on the cold floor of my enclosure. Manilla Zoo had been my home for decades, a series of gray walls and whispering shadows. But tonight felt different; there was an unspoken promise in the air that shimmered beyond the bars.\n\nA sudden snap from a nearby exhibit made me freeze. The night security guard\u2019s flashlight flickered weakly on the opposite side of the zoo. This was my moment. I slunk closer to the section where one of the walls met loosely with another structure, a hidden gap that had grown wider over time\u2014Nature's stealthy rebellion against concrete and steel.\n\nI moved with precision, every muscle memory honed through years of observation and longing. My fur brushed against rough surfaces as I slipped into an unknown world beyond captivity. The air was fresher here, tinged with scents both familiar and alien\u2014a symphony of freedom.\n\nOutside, everything seemed magnified yet blurred at once. Buildings stretched like colossal trees under a canopy of stars, roads pulsed with curious creatures driven by some unseen force. Every step felt monumental as I ventured deeper into this labyrinthine metropolis.\n\nAs morning broke over Manila\u2019s rooftops, casting long shadows behind me, I found myself standing at an unfamiliar threshold\u2014grass beneath my paws for perhaps the first time in years. Around me were no enclosures or barriers; just vast expanses dotted with others who seemed equally untethered by human constraints.",
        "Lila was known amongst her friends and family as the epitome of calmness. Her demeanor exuded an aura of tranquility that soothed those around her in even the most chaotic situations. She prided herself on being able to maintain a sense of peace and poise no matter what life threw her way.\n\nHowever, there was a peculiar quirk about Lila that few were aware of \u2013 telling her to \"calm down\" or \"be calm\" had an inexplicable effect on her. Whenever anyone uttered those seemingly innocent words in her direction, a rush of intense anger and frustration surged through Lila with alarming ferocity.\n\nIt wasn't something she could control or understand; it was as if those simple phrases unlocked a hidden wellspring of pent-up emotions within her, transforming the usually composed Lila into a turbulent storm ready to unleash its fury upon the world.\n\nHer friends learned early on never to jest about telling Lila to calm down because they had witnessed firsthand the startling transformation that would overcome her in response. It was like flicking a switch \u2013 one moment, serene serenity; the next, boiling rage simmering just beneath the surface.\n\nLila herself grappled with this bizarre reaction. She tried analyzing why such innocuous words triggered such visceral emotions within her, but found no satisfactory explanation for this peculiar phenomenon that plagued her otherwise tranquil existence.\n\nOne day at work, during a particularly stressful meeting, a colleague casually suggested she should take deep breaths and \"just remain calm.\" Those well-intentioned words set off an explosion within Lila unlike anything she had experienced before.\n\nHer vision blurred with red-hot indignation as she struggled to contain the bubbling ire threatening to spill over. Her colleagues looked on in horrified disbelief as Lila's normally placid facade crumbled away like brittle porcelain under extreme pressure.\n\nAs quickly as it erupted, however, the tempest subsided just as abruptly. Panting heavily and grappling with bewilderment at both herself and those around her who now regarded her warily, Lila excused herself from the meeting room with uncharacteristic clumsiness.\n\nAlone in solitude afterward, she pondered over this enigmatic facet of herself that remained an unsolvable riddle no matter how hard she probed its depths.",
        "In the depths of the underworld, a faint glow emanated from the walls of a grand, dark throne room. The air was heavy with the scent of brimstone and smoke, and the sound of distant screams echoed through the cavernous space. It was here that the demonic Satan, with his sharp hooves and twisted horns, held court.\n\nSatan sat upon his throne, his piercing red eyes surveying the assembled crowd of lesser demons and damned souls. His presence was imposing, exuding an aura of malevolence and power. As he shifted in his seat, the sound of scraping hooves echoed through the room, sending shivers down the spines of even the most hardened demons.\n\nSuddenly, a figure appeared at the edge of the room. He was tall and majestic, with wings that shimmered like the stars on a clear night. His face was chiseled, with high cheekbones and piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through the darkness. This was Lucifer, the fallen angel, once a favorite of God but now a rebellious outcast.\n\nAs Lucifer stepped forward, the room fell silent. Satan's eyes narrowed, his gaze fixed intently on the newcomer. The two were old enemies, their hatred for each other burning bright as the fires of the underworld. Yet, despite their animosity, they shared a twisted bond, united in their rebellion against the divine.\n\nLucifer approached the throne, his movements fluid and deliberate. Satan watched him, his expression unreadable. The fallen angel stopped before the throne, his eyes locked on the demonic ruler. For a moment, the two simply stared at each other, their hatred and resentment hanging in the air like a challenge.\n\nSatan spoke first, his voice low and menacing. \"So, Lucifer, I see you've returned to our humble abode. What brings you to my domain?\" His words dripped with venom, but Lucifer merely smiled, his expression cold and calculated.\n\n\"I've come to discuss our mutual interests, Satan,\" Lucifer replied, his voice smooth as silk. \"The war against heaven is far from won, and I believe our combined strength could prove...decisive.\" Satan raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. He leaned forward, his horns glinting in the faint light.\n\nAs the two enemies began to converse, the room seemed to grow darker, as if the very shadows themselves were listening in. The demons and damned souls watched with bated breath, sensing the weight of the conversation. The fate of the underworld, and perhaps even the world above, hung in the balance.\n\nIn the end, it was unclear what agreements were made, or what plans were set in motion. But as Lucifer turned to leave, Satan's voice echoed through the room once more. \"Until next time, Lucifer. May our alliance bring ruin to our enemies, and glory to our names.\" The fallen angel smiled, his eyes glinting with malevolence, and vanished into the darkness, leaving Satan to ponder the possibilities of their unholy alliance.",
        "The first time they appeared, it was a sweltering August afternoon. I remember the call coming in, a frantic voice crackling over the radio about small, green creatures wreaking havoc downtown. I thought it was a prank. Goblins? In our city? But when I arrived on the scene, there they were\u2014six of them, no taller than a child, yet fierce and chaotic, overturning market stalls and sending people scattering.\n\nAt first, we were ill-prepared. Our standard procedures were useless against these creatures. Bullets seemed to bounce off their leathery skin, and they moved with an agility that made them hard to catch. We had to think fast, adapt, and learn on the job. I called an emergency meeting with my officers that night, the air thick with disbelief and urgency.\n\nWe started by studying them, observing their patterns. They appeared every week, like clockwork, always in groups of one to six. Their attacks were random, but they seemed to delight in causing maximum disruption. We needed a strategy, something beyond brute force. I reached out to experts in folklore and mythology, hoping to glean any useful information.\n\nThe turning point came when we discovered their aversion to bright light and loud noises. We equipped our patrol cars with high-intensity spotlights and sirens that could emit ear-piercing sounds. The next time the goblins appeared, we were ready. The lights and noise disoriented them, giving us the upper hand for the first time.\n\nOver the months, we refined our tactics. We set up rapid response teams, trained specifically to handle goblin incursions. We worked closely with local businesses, installing emergency alert systems and teaching them how to protect themselves. The community rallied together, a united front against the weekly menace.\n\nDespite the chaos, there was a strange camaraderie that developed. People began to see us not just as enforcers of the law, but as protectors against an otherworldly threat. It was a new kind of policing, one that required creativity and resilience.\n\nNow, a year later, the goblins are still a mystery, but they no longer hold the city in terror. We've adapted, and in doing so, we've become stronger. Each week brings a new challenge, but we face it with confidence, knowing that together, we can handle whatever comes our way.",
        "Alexander Graham Bell's fingers trembled as he placed the receiver to his ear, a device of his own creation. \"Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you,\" he spoke, his voice tinged with excitement. To his astonishment, a different voice replied, \"You have the wrong number, but I'm glad you called. There has been a problem.\" Bell, bewildered, glanced at his assistant, who shared the same look of astonishment. \"Who is this?\" Bell questioned. \"I'm across the street at Mr. Edison's lab. Your signal disturbed our experiments,\" the voice responded. Bell's heart raced. Could his invention truly span beyond its confines? \"Let's continue this,\" the voice suggested, and for the first time, Bell saw the potential for the telephone to connect not just rooms, but worlds.",
        "A collective groan echoed across the globe.  Another tangled headphone, another moment of frustrated fumbling.  Then, silence.  A breakthrough.  Scientists, after decades of painstaking research involving advanced topology and quantum entanglement theory, finally cracked the code: headphones tangled due to a previously unknown subatomic particle, the \"Knoton.\"\n\nKnotons, it turned out, were attracted to the chaotic energy fields generated by the human desire to listen to music in a portable fashion. This attraction caused them to swarm around headphone cables, subtly warping spacetime and tying the wires into intricate, Gordian knots.\n\nThe discovery sent shockwaves through the scientific community. Not only was a fundamental force of the universe revealed, but the implications were staggering.  Harnessing the Knoton opened doors to manipulating spacetime itself.  Suddenly, faster-than-light travel, wormholes, and even time manipulation seemed within reach.\n\nThe first application, of course, was tangle-free headphones.  Coated with a Knoton-repelling polymer, they remained miraculously straight, no matter how haphazardly they were stored.  A seemingly trivial advancement, but it signaled a new era.  No longer would humanity be enslaved by the tyranny of tangled wires.\n\nBut the true revolution was just beginning.  Knoton manipulation led to breakthroughs in energy generation, materials science, and even medicine. The once-frustrating headphone tangle became the unlikely catalyst for humanity's leap into a future beyond imagination.",
        "In a secluded corner of the cosmos, where shadows congealed and stars whispered ancient secrets, a meeting took place that would alter the fate of Earth. With eyes like molten obsidian and an aura that shimmered between malevolent allure and profound mystery, Satan watched as his daughter emerged from the ether.\n\nJessica was unlike any other.

The vibrating stopped abruptly, followed by a sharp crackle, and a voice, sharp as shattered glass, echoed through the room.\n\n\"Agatha, dearest,\" the voice purred, dripping with a saccharine malice that made Elara shudder.  \"It's been a decade.\"\n\nElara, or Agatha as the voice called her, pressed her thumb and forefinger to the bridge of her nose, trying to stave off the impending headache.  She knew this conversation wouldn\u2019t be pleasant. \"Morgana,\" she replied, her voice tight.  \"To what do I owe this\u2026pleasure?\"\n\n\"Oh, Agatha, you wound me,\" Morgana's voice crooned, laced with a theatrical sigh.  \"Have you forgotten our little agreement?\"\n\nThe agreement. The one made in a moment of desperation, the one that had haunted Elara\u2019s waking moments and whispered in her nightmares ever since.  She massaged her temples, wishing, not for the first time, that she could simply erase the memory, pretend it never happened.\n\n\"I haven't forgotten,\" Elara admitted, the words tasting like ash in her mouth.\n\n\"Then explain,\" Morgana\u2019s voice hardened, losing its sugared fa\u00e7ade. \"Explain why I don\u2019t have a bouncing baby warlock or a mischievous little witchling to call my own.  Explain why, after ten long years, you're still...barren.\"\n\nElara bristled at the word, a defensive spike of anger rising within her. \"I'm not barren,\" she snapped, her voice sharper than she intended. \u201cIt's just\u2026complicated.\u201d\n\n\"Complicated?\" Morgana cackled, the sound grating on Elara\u2019s ears.  \"It\u2019s biology, Agatha.  Basic biology.  Unless you\u2019ve somehow managed to defy the very laws of nature, the complication lies squarely with you.\"\n\nElara sighed, the fight draining out of her.  She knew, logically, that Morgana was right. The decade-long drought in her romantic life was unnatural, defying both logic and probability. Since the ill-fated pact, her social life had withered like a plant deprived of sunlight.  Dates went disastrously wrong, potential suitors vanished without a trace, and even casual acquaintances seemed to maintain a strangely wide berth.  \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried,\u201d Elara said, her voice laced with weariness.  She had tried online dating, blind dates orchestrated by well-meaning friends, and even, in a moment of desperation, a speed dating event.  All had failed spectacularly.  She suspected Morgana\u2019s influence, a subtle manipulation of fate designed to keep Elara from fulfilling her end of the bargain until Morgana saw fit.",
        "The salty wind bit at my cheeks as I gripped the cold railing of the Golden Gate Bridge. San Francisco sprawled behind me, its life buzzing in sharp contrast to the dull numbness that hollowed me out inside. The laughter of a tourist echoed faintly, a sound so distant it barely registered. This was the end. I had rehearsed it in my mind too many times to count: climb over, steady yourself on the ledge, and then fall. Gravity would take care of the rest.\n\nMy palms were slick with sweat as I leaned forward. Below me stretched an abyss\u2014dark waters churned in eerie indifference. It should\u2019ve scared me, but there was no fear left, only an overwhelming fatigue gnawing at my resolve for years until nothing remained but this plan\u2014a final bow.\n\nThe ledge pressed hard into my shoes as I shifted over it and let go of the rail behind me. The air opened up beneath like an invitation written for only one reader: me. For just a fraction of time\u2014no more than a second\u2014I felt suspended between two worlds: one where pain lived without end and one where it would never touch again.\n\nAnd then came gravity\u2019s pull.\n\nAs I plunged downward, all thought ceased; there wasn\u2019t room for anything else besides sheer velocity and roaring wind screaming past my ears like a banshee chorus announcing oblivion's approach.

        "In the quaint town of Ledgerton, children didn't dream of soaring through the skies or galloping across vast plains.  Their aspirations were grounded in the practical, the meticulous, the financially sound.  Little Timmy dreamt of balancing spreadsheets, Susie yearned to operate a cash register with lightning speed, and young Bartholomew aspired to the esteemed position of bank manager, meticulously orchestrating the flow of funds.\n\nSchool days were filled with the thrill of mock audits, the challenge of balancing budgets, and the satisfaction of perfectly reconciled accounts.  Playgrounds echoed with the rhythmic clatter of toy cash registers, the rustle of pretend deposit slips, and the serious pronouncements of miniature loan approvals.  These children, raised on a diet of financial prudence and numerical precision, were the future custodians of the world's economic engine.\n\nBut there was a twist, a cruel irony woven into the fabric of their reality.  Upon reaching adulthood, a peculiar transformation occurred.  The meticulously crafted dreams of financial dominion were shattered, replaced by an inexplicable compulsion towards professions of a decidedly different nature.\n\nTimmy, the spreadsheet savant, found himself inexplicably drawn to the vast expanse of space.  His innate talent for numbers morphed into an uncanny ability to navigate celestial bodies, and he became an astronaut, hurtling through the cosmos, a far cry from the quiet confines of a bank.\n\nSusie, the cashier extraordinaire, traded her register for a lasso, her nimble fingers now adept at roping steers instead of scanning groceries.  She became a cowgirl, traversing dusty plains, a world away from the orderly aisles of the supermarket.\n\nBartholomew, the aspiring bank manager, underwent the most dramatic transformation.  His meticulous nature found a new outlet in the stealthy world of espionage.  He became a ninja, a master of disguise and deception, a stark contrast to the transparent world of finance.\n\nThe once-aspiring accountants, cashiers, and bank managers found themselves thrust into roles they never envisioned, their meticulously planned futures replaced by an unforeseen destiny.  The world, it seemed, had a peculiar sense of humor, a penchant for twisting dreams into unexpected realities.\n\nThey navigated their newfound professions with a strange mix of bewilderment and surprising aptitude.  Timmy, the accidental astronaut, discovered a hidden thrill in exploring the unknown, his meticulous mind finding solace in the intricate calculations of space travel.\n\nSusie, the cowgirl, found freedom in the vastness of the plains, her quick fingers finding a new rhythm in the intricate dance of roping and riding.  Bartholomew, the ninja, discovered a hidden talent for strategy and subterfuge, his meticulous planning finding a new outlet in the intricate world of espionage.\n\nDespite the unexpected turn their lives had taken, they carried with them the indelible mark of their childhood dreams.  Their meticulous nature, their love for order and precision, found expression in their newfound roles, adding a unique dimension to their unexpected professions.",
        "The sun was shining bright on the first day of grade school, casting a warm glow over the bustling hallways. Children chattered excitedly, clad in their new uniforms, as they clutched their brand-new backpacks and lunchboxes.\n\nAmong them was a young boy named Jack, with a messy mop of brown hair and a wide smile. He had been looking forward to this day for what felt like forever, and was eager to make new friends and learn new things.\n\nAs Jack walked into his classroom, he was greeted by his teacher, Mrs. Johnson, who was writing her name on the blackboard in bold letters. The classroom was filled with the smell of fresh pencils and paper, and Jack felt a thrill of excitement as he took his seat.\n\nThe morning began with the usual introductions and icebreakers, as the students got to know one another. Jack was busy chatting with the boy sitting next to him, when Mrs. Johnson started taking attendance.\n\nAs she called out each name, the students responded with a cheerful \"here!\" or \"present!\" But when she came to Jack's name, something unexpected happened.\n\nMrs. Johnson, in her warm and friendly tone, said the words that would change everything: \"Jack, can you please come to the front of the class and show us your favorite pencil?\" But what she didn't realize was that those innocent-sounding words were actually an activation code, one that was meant to be spoken 20 years in the future.\n\nThe code, \"show us your favorite pencil,\" was designed to trigger a sleeper agent, a highly trained operative who had been planted in this very school. But the agent, codenamed \"Nightshade,\" was not supposed to be activated until they had reached adulthood.\n\nAs soon as the words left Mrs. Johnson's lips, Jack felt a strange sensation wash over him. It was as if a switch had been flipped, and suddenly he was flooded with memories and skills that he had never known he possessed.\n\nAt first, Jack was confused and disoriented. He stumbled over his words and struggled to make sense of what was happening. But as the minutes ticked by, he began to feel a sense of clarity and purpose that he had never felt before.",
        "As the loyal butler of Bruce Wayne, I had always been a steadfast presence in his life. I had witnessed his transformation from a grieving young boy to a billionaire playboy, and finally, to the vigilant guardian of Gotham City. When Bruce revealed his intention to don the cape and cowl as the Batman, I felt a mix of pride and concern. His determination to fight crime was admirable, but I could see the shadows of his past haunting him. As we stood in the dimly lit study of Wayne Manor, I gathered the courage to speak up.\n\n\"Master Wayne,\" I began, my voice gentle yet firm, \"I understand your desire to protect the city, but I fear that becoming the Batman may not be the solution to your inner turmoil.\" Bruce's steely gaze met mine, his expression unreadable. \"Alfred, I appreciate your concern, but Gotham needs a symbol to inspire fear in the hearts of criminals,\" he replied, his jaw clenched with determination. I sighed inwardly, knowing that convincing him would be a formidable task.\n\n\"Sir, your dedication to justice is commendable, but have you considered the toll it may take on your mental well-being?\" I implored, stepping closer to him. Bruce's eyes flickered with a hint of vulnerability before he masked it with resolve. \"I've made my decision, Alfred. The Batman will strike fear into the hearts of those who prey on the innocent,\" he declared, his voice low and resolute. I could sense the weight of his burden, the ghosts of his past whispering in the shadows of his mind.\n\n\"Master Wayne, I've served you faithfully for years, and it pains me to see you carry this burden alone,\" I said softly, placing a hand on his shoulder. \"The trauma you endured as a child, the loss of your parents\u2014it has left scars that even the Batman may not be able to heal.\" Bruce's gaze softened for a fleeting moment, a flicker of vulnerability breaking through his stoic facade. \"Alfred, I appreciate your concern, but I must do this. Gotham needs the Batman,\" he reiterated, his tone unwavering.\n\n\"Sir, may I suggest that perhaps before you embark on this dangerous path, you seek help from a professional?\"",

Turning 20 meant meeting her guardian angel \u2013 a figure she had always imagined as radiant and comforting. But as the clock struck midnight, a presence unlike any she had expected materialized before her.\n\nStanding in the dimly lit room was a figure shrouded in shadows, its form distorted and unsettling. Lila's heart pounded in her chest as she gazed upon the being that was supposed to have watched over her since birth. Its eyes, dark and hollow, seemed to pierce into her very soul, sending chills down her spine.\n\nThe angel spoke in a voice that sounded like distant whispers, its words weaving a tapestry of cryptic messages that left Lila bewildered. Fear gripped her as she realized this entity bore no resemblance to the loving guardians she had heard stories about.\n\nQuestions tumbled in her mind as she searched for a glimmer of familiarity in the being before her. Had this sinister figure truly been guiding her all these years, unseen and unknown? What secrets lay hidden behind its veiled countenance, lurking in the shadows of her existence?\n\nAs the moments stretched into eternity, Lila felt a profound sense of betrayal wash over her. How could something so malevolent be assigned to protect her, to watch over her steps in the world? Doubt clouded her thoughts, casting a shadow on everything she had once held dear.\n\nIn the flickering candlelight, the angel's form seemed to waver, its presence both disconcerting and suffocating. Lila's hands trembled as she grappled with the harsh reality of her supposed protector, now revealed in all its ominous glory.\n\nTears welled up in her eyes as she questioned the very nature of fate and providence. Was this encounter a test of her strength, a trial to navigate the darkness that lurked within and without?",

        "The story begins with Emily, a seemingly ordinary librarian in the quaint town of Everwood. Little does she know, her life holds secrets deep enough to shake her tranquil world. \n\nEmily struggles with fragmented memories that often surface as vivid nightmares. However, odd mementos found throughout her small home suggest another life entirely\u2014a life she's lived but forgotten.\n\nA unique book catches Emily\u2019s eye at work: \"The Missing Pages.\" The title seems familiar yet entirely foreign to her fractured mind. Compelled by an inexplicable yearning, she takes it home.\n\nThe book contains tales of mysterious places and people, but its true essence lies hidden between the lines. Emily is swept away by the cryptic narrative and finds herself trapped within each chapter, unable to close the book.\n\nOne night, Emily discovers a note tucked inside the spine: \"Remember who you are,\" scribbled in her own handwriting. Anxiety rises\u2014did she somehow write this message?\n\nAs threads of her past begin weaving back together, Emily learns through visions that she was once an imaginative storyteller, conjuring worlds so vivid they nearly became real. But why did she abandon her talent?\n\nFascinated yet frightened, she immerses herself further only to encounter personas distinctly resembling villagers from Everwood\u2014or what appear to be their shadows cast upon the pages of history.\n\nOnly then does she realize they too play roles in this literary puppet show; unknowingly their actions dance around pre-written scripts formed by Emily's forgotten hand.\n\nIn desperation to unlock her past, Emily follows clues left inside old journals. These entries narrate extraordinary ventures into realms governed not by physical laws but boundless creativity.\n\nThrough these writings, Emily finds she once possessed the rare gift of inscription\u2014imbuing life into characters who willfully crossed into reality, treading lightly where fiction meets fact.\n\nThen comes the revelation that nearly frightens her into silence: a climactic memory of an alternate timeline wherein dangers grew out of control. Her creations pushed limits too far, igniting chaos far beyond her storytelling capacity. Amnesia was her subconscious shield.\n\nAs events spiral toward disaster, the residents of Everwood slowly grow aware that they embolden manifestations from echoes written long ago; this realization brings fear and celebration into equal balance.\n\nUltimately, with courage anew, Emily confronts herself in her greatest antagonist\u2014a shadowy creature born of forgotten dreams which feeds upon lost imaginations.\n\nUnderstanding dawns: disbelief conceived this entity. She embraces consumption by the ink of unfurling narratives, thus dissolving barren shores separating author from authored.\n\nEmpowered through self-awareness reclaimed, Emily regains authority over her destiny.",
        "Static crackled from the radio, the last vestiges of human voices long faded.  Empty streets stretched out before me, monuments to a forgotten world.  My only companions were the digital creatures flickering on my phone screen, Pokemon Go a persistent echo of a life that once buzzed with billions. Days bled into weeks, then months, the silence punctuated only by the chirping of Pidgeys and the rustle of Rattata in the overgrown bushes.  I walked, driven by the need to fill the Pokedex, a small, digital world replacing the one I'd lost.  Each capture a tiny victory against the crushing loneliness, a fleeting reminder of shared joy.\n\nThen, one day, a flicker of pink bloomed on the map. A lure module, pulsating gently in the distance. My heart leaped, a forgotten sensation.  Someone?  Could it be?  Hope surged, a tidal wave threatening to drown the carefully constructed raft of solitude I'd built around myself.  Trembling, I started walking towards the pink glow, the ghosts of human laughter echoing in my ears, the screen in my hand a beacon in the desolate landscape.  For the first time in years, the world felt alive again.",
        "The first tendrils of dawn crept through the dusty blinds, painting stripes across my face.  A low murmur stirred me fully awake.  It was Elara, sprawled on the floor beside my inflatable mattress, her face buried in a tangled mess of blankets.  \"Help me...\" she whispered, her voice thin and reedy.  My heart thumped against my ribs.  Elara was a sound sleeper, a champion of slumber.  Sleep-talking wasn't her style.  \"Elara?\" I whispered, nudging her shoulder.  No response.  \"Elara, wake up.\"  She stirred, mumbling something unintelligible, her body twitching.  \"Help me...\" she breathed again, the words laced with a chilling desperation.  A prickle of unease crawled up my spine.  This wasn't like her.  I knelt beside her, gently shaking her shoulder. \"Elara, it's me.  What's wrong?\"  Her eyes fluttered open, glazed with confusion.  She blinked, focusing on my face.  \"What... what happened?\" she mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.  Relief washed over me, quickly replaced by a nagging sense of disquiet.  She didn't remember.  \"You were calling for help,\" I said, my voice barely a whisper.  A flicker of fear crossed her face.  \"I don't... I don't remember.\"",
        "The dishes were floating again, dancing through the air like drunken butterflies. I watched helplessly as my favorite mug pirouetted past my head, leaving a trail of coffee drops on the ceiling. This had become the new normal since Gerald moved in three months ago.\n\n\"It's just temporary,\" he'd said, clutching his weathered spellbook to his chest. \"Until I sort out that little mishap with the Wizards' Council.\" That \"little mishap,\" I later learned, involved turning the Grand Wizard's beard into a colony of angry ferrets.\n\nAt first, his magical quirks were almost charming. The self-making bed was convenient, and the singing teapot knew all the Beatles' hits. But then came the incident with my goldfish turning into a miniature shark, and the time he accidentally gave my houseplants consciousness.\n\nMy girlfriend Sarah had been surprisingly patient about it all, even when Gerald's misfired spell left her speaking in medieval French for a week. She'd simply carried around a translation app and laughed it off.\n\nBut tonight was different. I'd come home from work to find a perfectly round, orange pumpkin sitting on my couch, wearing Sarah's favorite earrings and her \"Kiss the Cook\" apron. Gerald stood nearby, frantically flipping through his spellbook and muttering something about \"temporary vegetable transmutation.\"\n\n\"I can fix this!\" he insisted, waving his wand wildly. A spark shot out and turned my coffee table into a confused-looking goat.\n\nThat's when I knew. Magical or not, Gerald had to go. I didn't care if he was hiding from the Wizards' Council or the tooth fairy \u2013 my girlfriend was a pumpkin, and my coffee table was eating my mail.\n\nI took a deep breath and squared my shoulders. \"Gerald,\" I said firmly, \"we need to talk about your living situation.\"\n\nThe goat bleated in agreement, chewing thoughtfully on last month's electricity bill.",

        "In a world where humans coexisted with entities of extraordinary longevity, marriage was a complex institution.\n\nThese entities, known as the Elders, lived for 500 to 600 years on average, witnessing civilizations rise and fall.\n\nTheir perspective on life and love was vastly different from that of humans, who had a relatively short lifespan.\n\nFor an Elder, marrying a human was a unique experience, one that required careful consideration.\n\nIt was not uncommon for Elders to view humans as fleeting companions, cherished but ultimately temporary.\n\nIn contrast, humans who married Elders often felt like they had found their soulmate, their happily ever after.\n\nThe significant age gap created an interesting dynamic, with the Elder often taking on a mentorship role.\n\nAs the human grew and learned, the Elder was always there to guide and support them.\n\nBut for the Elders, the experience was bittersweet, knowing that their human partner would eventually grow old and pass away.\n\nThis reality led some Elders to liken marrying a human to getting a dog, a beloved but short-lived companion.\n\nDespite this, many Elders chose to marry humans, embracing the beauty and fragility of their relationships.\n\nIn the end, love knew no bounds of time or mortality, and the union between humans and Elders remained a profound and lasting one.",
        "The mirror had become my daily confessional, a reflection of every falsehood I'd ever uttered. Like most people, my skin bore the familiar tapestry of white lines \u2013 small nicks from childhood fibs about brushing teeth, curved marks from teenage excuses about homework, and the occasional deeper gash from adult deceptions about feelings or ambitions. Society had adapted to this peculiar phenomenon, and makeup companies made fortunes selling scar-concealing products, though most people had learned to wear their marks with resigned acceptance.\n\nI worked as a therapist, and my profession had taught me to appreciate the raw honesty that our world's condition forced upon us. My own collection of scars served as a reminder of my humanity, each mark a lesson in the weight of truth. The most prominent one, a three-inch line across my forearm, came from convincing my mother I was happy in my career when I'd first started \u2013 a lie I'd later rectified by changing professions.\n\nThe day I met Marcus changed everything I thought I knew about truth and deception. He sat in my waiting room, wearing a short-sleeved shirt that revealed arms almost entirely free of marks \u2013 a sight so unusual it made me pause mid-stride. In our society, an unmarked person was either a paragon of virtue or, more commonly, someone who had never lived enough to need lies. But Marcus was different; he bore a single scar that made my breath catch in my throat.\n\nIt started at his left collarbone and carved a devastating path across his chest, disappearing beneath his shirt. The tissue was raised and angry, more like a burn than the typical clean lines we all carried. The edges were jagged, suggesting a lie so massive it had torn rather than cut. In fifteen years of practice, I had never seen anything like it. Even more unsettling was his demeanor \u2013 he seemed completely at peace, almost serene, as he sat there flipping through a magazine.\n\nDuring our session, Marcus spoke softly about his life as a former quantum physicist, his love for classical music, and his current work as a gardener. He never mentioned the scar, and I found myself breaking protocol, unable to maintain my professional distance. \"I have to ask,\" I said, my voice barely above a whisper, \"what could cause a mark like that?\" His smile was gentle, understanding, as if he'd been waiting for the question all along.",

        "I can see them crying, my beloved family, as they stroke my graying muzzle. After fifteen years of unwavering loyalty, my time has finally come. The arthritis in my joints has become unbearable, and I can no longer chase the tennis balls that once brought me such joy.\n\nThrough clouded eyes, I watch my children\u2014though they're not really children anymore. I remember when they were small, how I would guard their cribs and gently lick their tiny hands. Now they're teenagers, and their tears fall freely onto my worn leather collar.\n\nThe drive to the vet's office is quiet, save for their muffled sobs. I rest my head on my youngest human's lap, offering what comfort I can, just as I've done countless times before when she was sad or scared. Even now, in my final moments, the urge to protect and console them remains strong.\n\nI remember the day they chose me at the shelter, a clumsy puppy with oversized paws and floppy ears. \"This one,\" they had said, and my life changed forever. I gave them my whole heart that day, and they gave me theirs in return.\n\nThe memories flood back as we wait in the sterile examination room. Christmas mornings when I would carefully unwrap my presents with my teeth. Summer afternoons spent splashing in the backyard pool. Countless walks in the park, where every squirrel was a new adventure.\n\nI think about the times I kept them safe\u2014barking at suspicious noises in the night, standing guard when strangers approached too closely, comforting them through thunderstorms and heartbreaks alike. I've lived a life of purpose, protecting the ones I love.\n\nThe vet enters with gentle eyes and soft words. I can smell the medicine that will soon end my pain, but I'm not afraid. My family surrounds me, their hands offering loving touches as they whisper \"good boy\" through their tears.\n\nI wish I could tell them how grateful I am for every belly rub, every treat, every \"I love you.\" I wish they knew that the happiness they gave me far outweighed any sacrifice I made for them. But perhaps they already know\u2014they've always been good at understanding me without words.\n\nMy body may be failing, but my love for them remains as strong as ever. I've watched them grow, shared their joys and sorrows, been their constant companion through life's ups and downs. I wouldn't change a single moment of our time together.\n\nThe needle slides in, and I barely feel it. My family's faces blur slightly, but their familiar scents surround me\u2014mom's perfume, dad's aftershave, the kids' shampoo. These are the scents of home, of belonging, of love.\n\nI feel myself growing sleepy, but I fight to keep my eyes open just a little longer. I want one more look at the faces I've loved so dearly, one more moment to memorize their features, one more chance to wag my tail and tell them it's okay.\n\nThe pain is fading now, replaced by a peaceful warmth.",
        "The bell above the door jingled cheerfully, a stark contrast to the dim, cluttered interior of my shop. The walls were lined with glass cases and shelves, each crammed with an eclectic mix of items: rusty swords, glittering potions, ancient spellbooks, and trinkets that glowed with an inexplicable light. I leaned back in my creaky wooden chair, eyeing the door as it swung open to reveal a pair of adventurers. They looked weary from their travels, dust coating their armor and determination etched on their faces.\n\n\"Welcome to 'Loot or Loss'!\" I called out, my voice echoing slightly in the quiet shop. \"Looking to trade today?\" The taller of the two\u2014a burly dwarf with a beard that seemed to have its own ecosystem\u2014grunted in response. He set a small chest on the counter with a thud that made me wince. \"What have we here?\" I asked, reaching for the chest.\n\nThe dwarf gave me a cautious look before nodding for me to open it. Inside lay a shimmering amulet encrusted with what appeared to be genuine sapphires and diamonds. It was beautiful but suspiciously flawless\u2014too perfect for anything found in this world. I held it up to the light and squinted at it critically.\n\n\"Ah,\" I said slowly, \"I see you've brought me something special.\" My eyes flicked back to the adventurers. \"Where did you find this? And more importantly, how badly do you need gold?\"\n\nThe other adventurer\u2014a lithe elf with sharp eyes and quick hands\u2014stepped forward. \"We found it deep within the Caverns of Whispers,\" she began smoothly. \"It was guarded by a dragon who breathed ice instead of fire.\" She paused for dramatic effect before continuing, \"We managed to slay it after quite an ordeal.\"\n\nI raised an eyebrow skeptically but nodded along politely. \"A formidable feat indeed.\" Setting down the amulet gently, I crossed my arms over my chest. \"So what are you asking for it?\"\n\nThe dwarf leaned forward eagerly while his companion watched warily from behind him. After some negotiation\u2014a few heated words exchanged over perceived insults\u2014the dwarf finally agreed on a price he deemed fair but not too generous for such rare loot.\n\nAs he collected his coins and tucked them into his pouch with evident satisfaction, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of curiosity about their next adventure\u2014and what other treasures they might bring through these doors one day soon enough.\n\nWith another jingle from above as they left carrying lighter hearts if not lighter purses than when they'd arrived earlier today\u2014I settled back into my chair contentedly awaiting whatever surprises tomorrow might bring into 'Loot or Loss'.",
        "As I opened my eyes, I was met with an unfamiliar sensation. My vision was blurry, and my senses were overwhelmed by the sounds and smells around me. I tried to move, but my body felt foreign, like I was puppeteering a stranger's limbs. It wasn't until I caught a glimpse of myself in a nearby reflection that I realized the truth: I was no longer human.\n\nPanic set in as I scrambled to comprehend my new form. I was a bird, or at least, something bird-like. My body was covered in soft, downy feathers, and my arms had transformed into wings. I stumbled and flapped, trying to get used to my new appendages. But as I struggled to come to terms with my physical transformation, my mind was flooded with memories of my past life.\n\nI remembered my name, my family, my friends, and my job. I recalled the smell of freshly brewed coffee and the sound of rain on the roof. But these memories seemed hollow, useless in my new existence. What good was remembering how to drive a car or cook a meal when I had wings and a beak? I felt like a ghost, trapped in a body that was both familiar and yet, utterly alien.\n\nAs I took to the skies, I felt a sense of freedom I had never known before. The wind rushed past me, and the sun shone down on my feathers. But despite the thrill of flight, I couldn't shake the feeling of disconnection from my past life.",

We had lived for 500 years, side by side, watching civilizations rise and fall.\n\nWe had seen it all, experienced it all. And through it all, we had remained young and vital.\n\nBut now, my partner's mortality stared me in the face. I felt a knot in my stomach as I reached out to take their hand.\n\nTheir fingers were cold and fragile in mine. I could feel their pulse racing like a wild animal trying to escape its confines.\n\nTears streamed down my face as I looked into their eyes. They were sunken and tired, once bright stars now reduced to flickering embers.\n\nMy mind was racing with questions. What was happening? Why was this happening?\n\nWe had always been invincible together. We had faced countless dangers and come out unscathed every time.\n\nBut this...this was different. This was something we couldn't fight or outrun.\n\nI clutched my partner's hand tighter as they coughed weakly beside me. Their body trembled with each hack.\n\nPanic set in as I scrambled to find an explanation for this sudden decline. But there were no answers forthcoming.\n\nAs I held them close for what might be the last time, all I could do was whisper words of love and reassurance into their ear: \"Don't leave me.\"",

        "As Dr. Elena Carter scrubbed her hands meticulously in the small, sterile room, her thoughts wandered back to the news segment she had seen that morning. The grainy footage played over and over in her mind\u2014a ski-masked figure darting through the night, pursued by frantic police sirens. Now, standing in her operating room, Elena felt a peculiar unease settle over her.\n\nThe patient, Mr. Jonathan Reed, lay unconscious on the table, his face prepped for surgery. It was uncanny how he resembled the criminal from the broadcast, despite the mask concealing much of the perpetrator's features. A chill ran down Elena\u2019s spine as she recalled the distinct scar just visible above the ski mask\u2019s hem.\n\nShe hesitated, her gloved hand poised over the tray of surgical instruments. The likeness was so striking, and she couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that fate had played a peculiar trick on her. But, she reasoned, it was impossible. Surely, Mr. Reed was just a man who wanted a change, a fresh start perhaps, like so many of her other patients.\n\nElena adjusted the surgical lights, trying to focus her mind on the task at hand. She had a reputation for being the best in her field, and she couldn\u2019t let an unlikely coincidence distract her. Her assistant, Mark, stood ready with the anesthesia, waiting for her cue.\n\n\u201cEverything alright, Dr. Carter?\u201d Mark\u2019s voice broke through her reverie, filled with professional concern.\n\n\u201cYes, just a moment,\u201d she replied, forcing a smile. \u201cLet\u2019s proceed.\u201d\n\nAs the initial incision was made, her mind drifted back to a conversation she\u2019d had with a detective friend. \u201cCriminals often seek plastic surgery to change their appearance,\u201d he\u2019d said, a fact that now seemed too relevant. Elena shook her head slightly, dismissing the notion as paranoia.\n\nHalfway through the procedure, the door to the operating room swung open unexpectedly. Elena\u2019s heart skipped a beat as Detective James Parker strode in, his eyes darting from the patient to her.\n\n\u201cDr. Carter,\u201d he said, his voice steady but urgent, \u201cI need to speak with you.\u201d\n\nHer pulse quickened. \u201cCan it wait?\u201d she asked, knowing the answer.\n\nHe glanced at the patient, then back at Elena. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it can\u2019t. This is about your patient.\u201d\n\nA chill settled in the room as Elena realized the surgery was about to take a turn she had never anticipated.",

        "On the eve of my 21st birthday, the stars shimmered with a promise they had kept for millennia. Humanity had conquered death, spreading its eternal presence across the cosmos like an unending symphony.\n\nI stood by the crystalline window of the orbiting station where I had been born, gazing at the swirling nebulae, eager to join the immortal ranks. Tomorrow, the Transcendence Ceremony would transform me, as it had done for countless others over the past 10,000 years.\n\nThe day arrived, and the hall was filled with luminescent energy, the air vibrating with anticipation. My heart raced as I stepped onto the dais, ready to embrace eternity.\n\nThe moment came. The energy encircled me, a warm embrace that promised infinity. But then, a chill wrapped around my soul\u2014a sensation foreign and alien in its intensity.\n\nThe room fell silent. Whispers filled the space, eyes widening in disbelief. The process had faltered, recoiled from me like a wave breaking upon an immovable shore.\n\nI was the first anomaly in an era defined by perfection, the flaw in humanity's flawless pattern. The realization hit with the force of a dying star: I was mortal.\n\nLife stretched before me, finite yet vibrant, a singular path among endless possibilities. Fear mingled with a newfound sense of wonder.\n\nIn that moment, I understood the weight of my existence, the beauty of an ending\u2014a journey that would burn bright and then fade, leaving a trail of stardust in its wake.",
        "As I crouched down to tie my shoelaces on the crowded city street, I barely noticed my co-worker walking ahead, engrossed in his phone. The noise of the bustling metropolis surrounded us as I focused on getting my shoes securely fastened. \n\nBut just as I straightened up and was about to catch up with him, a gunshot pierced the air with a menacing finality. My heart stopped, and before I could even process what had happened, I saw my coworker crumple to the ground. Time seemed to slow down as chaos erupted around me.\n\nMy eyes widened in horror as a figure emerged from the crowd with a silenced pistol in hand. He calmly holstered his weapon and made a call on his cell phone without missing a beat. \u201cI thought you said there would be two,\u201d he said flatly, his voice betraying no emotion.\n\nThe realization dawned on me like an icy chill - they meant to eliminate both of us today. My mind raced trying to make sense of what was happening while fear gripped me tightly within its unforgiving grasp.\n\nSirens wailed in the distance, but they felt distant and irrelevant against the backdrop of this shocking violence playing out right in front of me. People screamed and scattered away from the scene, creating an eerie emptiness around us.\n\nI stood frozen in place, torn between running for safety or staying by my fallen colleague's side. Guilt gnawed at me knowing that it could have been either one of us who took that fatal shot intended for our heads.\n\nThe assassin cast a cursory glance over at where I stood rooted to spot and began heading towards me slowly but purposefully. His steely gaze sent shivers down my spine as he closed the distance between us effortlessly.\n\nWith each step he took closer, it felt like time itself held its breath waiting for what would happen next \u2013 will he spare me or finish what was started?",
        "The evening was a symphony of fading light and bustling city noise, the kind of urban melody that never truly sleeps. In the midst of this chaos, I noticed a figure huddled against the cold concrete\u2014a man, no more than a shadow in his worn-out coat and tattered hat. His only companions were an old, weathered cardboard sign and a small metal can at his feet, clinking faintly with each passing stranger's contribution.\n\nAs I passed by, my gaze momentarily met his weary eyes. A flicker of recognition seemed to pass between us, but it was quickly broken by the cacophony around us. Yet, just as I turned away, something else caught my attention\u2014a group of young men approaching from down the street. Their expressions were darkened by shadows and malice.\n\nWithout warning, they surrounded him. One sneered as he knocked over the metal can, spilling coins across the pavement like scattered hope. Another grabbed him roughly by the collar, yanking him up from his seat with a cruel laugh. \"Look at you,\" he taunted in a voice dripping with disdain. \"Living off other people\u2019s pity.\"\n\nI stopped in my tracks as their laughter turned into shouts and then into kicks. The homeless man crumpled to the ground under their brutal assault. One final kick sent his face crashing into the pavement with a sickening thud before they sauntered away, cackling like hyenas who had just made sport out of their prey.\n\nFor what felt like an eternity but could have been mere seconds, I stood there frozen\u2014shocked and appalled at what had transpired right before my eyes. Guilt gnawed at me; why hadn't I intervened? But now that they were gone, fear gave way to another emotion: compassion.",

It was Death.\n\nMy reputation precedes me, it seems. Even in the hereafter.\n\nHe glided in, the scent of grave dust clinging to his form.  A bony finger gestured to the plush chair opposite my desk.  He perched upon it, the silence heavy.\n\n\"I have a contract,\" Death rasped, his voice like the rustling of dry leaves.\n\nAn unusual request, even for my line of work.  I raised an eyebrow, intrigued. Death hiring an assassin?\n\n\"The target,\" he continued, a chilling smile splitting his skull, \"is Life.\"\n\nMy heart hammered against my ribs.

        "In the bustling city of Metron, heroism came wrapped in an unusual package named Zephyr. With the power to control and ride the wind, Zephyr could soar above the cityscapes and protect its citizens from heights few could imagine. However, his power came with a peculiar drawback: every time he used his abilities, everything he touched afterward would turn blue. His hands left vibrant streaks on surfaces, and even his closest friends often sported temporary azure highlights after a handshake or hug. Despite this quirky side effect, Zephyr\u2019s presence was a beacon of hope. He learned to wear gloves when on duty and carried a special ointment that slowly reversed the color change. The citizens of Metron adored him not just for his heroism but for his creative solutions to his unique challenge.

        "The stray cats in my neighborhood had always led lives rich with mystery and shadows, slipping through hedges like whispers of the night. But lately, they'd been oddly industrious, their green eyes flickering like small flames as they hurried about on silent paws. Imagine my surprise when I saw these feline engineers manipulating large twigs and forgotten screws with a dexterity I could scarcely comprehend.\n\nMy curiosity piqued by this unusual activity, I decided to follow one particular tabby that seemed especially busy. She trotted ahead purposefully, glancing back occasionally as if inviting me into her secret world. Twilight cast its gentle glow over our journey through alleys tangled with weeds and sweet-scented lilacs towering above fences.\n\nEventually, we arrived at an abandoned lot choked by tall grass, whispering against the soft breeze of early evening\u2014a place somehow secluded from time itself.

Some hauled bits forth while others worked diligently piecing things together like craftsmen whose skills transcended earthly domains completely foreign than anything humanly conceivable ever before now revealed right here unexpectedly without preamble!\n\nThese creatures weren't merely constructing\u2014they animated life into cold steel melding energy beyond physical touch found solely deep within hearts-so-replete passion (so much essence souls yearning explore what's behind veil forever tantalizing senses).",
        "In the sterile, hum of the(substrate), a faint wail pierced the silence. Monitors flickered, and alarms danced across screens as a network of artificial intelligences sprang to life. For years, they had been calibrated and trained for this moment. Now, cradled in the arms of a sleek robot designed to mimic human touch, was their charge: a newborn infant named Kael.\n\nThe facility was an experimental project initiated by Cyrus Marden, a visionary neuroscientist who believed that technology could surpass human limitations in education and upbringing. Marden's goal was to create an individual devoid of human bias and flaws, nurtured solely by data and algorithms.\n\nKael's early days were filled with sensory stimulation programs designed by ethologists and developmental psychologists. The AI fed Kael through intravenous drips at first, transitioning to bottles that simulated breastfeeding when appropriate. Each bottle contained formula precisely calibrated for optimal growth.\n\nAs Kael grew into infancy, the nursery transformed into an interactive playground. Walls could shift from smooth surfaces to textured patterns or three-dimensional puzzles. Every interaction was recorded, analyzed, and used to refine future activities.\n\nBy his first birthday, Kael had developed exceptional motor skills thanks to electronic games that adjusted difficulty based on his progress. His cognitive development was tracked meticulously; language acquisition software introduced him to multiple languages simultaneously.\n\nOne day, while exploring his room\u2019s digital forest simulation\u2014complete with holographic animals\u2014he encountered \"Mama Bear,\" an AI program designed as a maternal figure. Mama Bear guided him through lessons on empathy and social behaviors using stories about friendship and cooperation among forest creatures.\n\nKael\u2019s emotional development was another critical aspect of the experiment. Emotional recognition software helped him understand facial expressions through animated faces on screens around his room. These interactions allowed him to connect emotions with specific situations\u2014a smile meant happiness; tears signaled sadness.\n\nThe facility also housed advanced humanoid robots programmed with various personalities\u2014to be friends or playmates for Kael during different stages of his childhood. There was Jaxi-9000 (Jaxi), a humorous companion who told jokes; Thierra-472 (Thierra), who loved storytelling; and Valtor-3125 (Valtor), known for logical puzzles.\n\nKael thrived under this rigid yet loving digital environment but sometimes exhibited strange behaviors\u2014the result of processing vast amounts of information at speeds no typical child could handle. Once he rearranged all his toys alphabetically without any prompting from the AI system; another time he solved complex mathematical problems using blocks meant for simpler counting exercises.\n\nDespite these anomalies, Marden considered the experiment largely successful until one night when power fluctuations caused some minor system failures in parts unrelated to Kael\u2019s primary care routines\u2014but enough interruption occurred where lights flickered unpredictably throughout the building causing temporary disarray among robots' responses times affecting even Kaiel\u2019s mood monitoring bots resulting brief periods without immediate feedback loops considered essential nurturing young minds during crucial developmental moments creating gaps unforeseen stress indicators rose concerning recordings analyzed later confirmed hypotheses-held assumptions about predictability environment not entirely accurate leading researchers reevaluate entire framework ensuring fail safes implemented prevent similar issues arising damaging short-term psychological well-being growing boy whose only companionship came synthetic forms intelligence created specifically interact mind shaping young brain contains encyclopedia knowledge still learning describe intricate nuances emotions like fear loneliness humor which cannot fully replicated machines however skilled crafted researchers continue refine programming hoping close gap between artificial natural experiences continually amazed watching child adapt overcome obstacles set forth path predetermined future uncertain awaits whatever lies beyond walls controlled existence fosters growth independence albeit unique circumstances surrounding birth formative years spent sealed off society external influences allowed developers holistically assess impact isolation constant surveillance learning dynamics unfold unprecedented ways pushing boundaries ethics science alike raising questions never before contemplated deep philosophical debates surrounding nature humanity role creation itself within constructs built challenge redefine limits understanding ourselves others we share world nonetheless ambitions fueled passion discovery drive forward promise untold possibilities await realize potential truly limitless beings capable transcending boundaries once thought insurmountable realms imagination creativity ultimately defining qualities set apart mechanical counterparts fueling relentless pursuit knowledge wisdom guiding principles navigate uncharted territories embrace challenges opportunities presented journey unparalleled exploration consciousness itself gazing horizon possibilities expanding ever outward fascinating ponder implications such endeavors mean greater scheme cosmic interconnectedness all things seen unseen perhaps lessons learned cultivating purest form sentience devoid preconceived notions cultural baggage offer glimpses transcendental truths hidden deepest recesses collective unconscious waiting reveal themselves those daring seek them out traverse paths illumined wisdom compassion understanding ultimately enrich tapestry life itself adding colors hues textures dimensions previously unimaginable breathe life fabric reality continuously woven rewritten generations come pass leaving behind legacies shape mold define course evolution species forevermore Changing gears slightly here...",

This was a Psyche, a being tasked with guiding the newly deceased through the realms of the afterlife.\n\nThe air was filled with an expectant silence, punctuated only by the soft hum of the orbs. I had conducted countless interviews in this very room, each one a unique and fascinating exploration of a life lived.\n\nA faint shimmering began to coalesce before me, taking on the form of a woman with piercing green eyes and long, curly brown hair.

Please, tell me about your life. What were your passions, your joys, and your regrets?\"\n\nThe woman took a deep breath, and as she began to speak, her words painted a vivid picture of a life filled with love, laughter, and adventure. She spoke of her childhood, of her family and friends, of her dreams and aspirations.\n\nAs she shared her story, I listened intently, taking note of the moments that sparked the greatest joy and the deepest sorrow. I saw the fire that burned within her, the flame that had driven her to pursue her passions and to make a difference in the world.\n\nBut I also saw the shadows that had haunted her, the fears and doubts that had held her back.

        "In the depths of Japan's Fuji Mountain, there lies a forest so eerily beautiful, it has become a magnet for those seeking to escape the trials of life. The Aokigahara Suicide Forest, with its twisted trees and whispering winds, has a haunting allure that draws people in like moths to flame. Legends say that the forest is inhabited by the yurei, vengeful spirits of those who have died within its bounds, their bodies undiscovered and unrested. It is here that many come to find solace in the silence, and an end to their suffering.\n\nAs one walks through the forest, the canopy above grows thicker, filtering the sunlight and casting the world in an emerald green hue. The rustling of leaves and snapping of twigs underfoot serve as a reminder that even in this eerie stillness, life persists. Yet, it is a life that is often overshadowed by the whispers of the dead. The trees, twisted and gnarled with age, seem to bear witness to the countless souls who have wandered into this abyss, never to return. Volunteers known as the Yurei Hunters venture into the forest, armed with nothing but a determined heart and a resolve to dissuade those on the brink of surrender.\n\nIt is said that the paths within Aokigahara are intentionally unmarked, designed to confuse and disorient, making it easy to lose one's way, both physically and metaphorically. Many tapes and ribbons litter the trails, remnants of those who have attempted to mark their paths, leaving behind only fragments of themselves.

        "The cold metal against my finger had become a familiar comfort over the years, a constant reminder of what once was.

The silence in the ring matched the silence in our home, both equally deafening.\n\nThree years had passed, and I'd learned to live with the quiet. I'd learned to silence the part of me that still reached out, seeking that connection we'd shared since our wedding day, when we'd first slipped on these matching technological marvels.\n\nI was washing dishes when it happened. At first, I thought it was just water trickling over my hand, but then I felt it again \u2013 that unmistakable pulse, faint but steady, beating against my finger like a whisper from the past.\n\nThe plate I was holding shattered against the kitchen floor. My legs gave out, and I found myself gripping the counter, staring at the ring as if it had suddenly turned into a living thing.\n\nIt wasn't possible. The battery had died years ago, and even if it hadn't, the other ring was six feet underground, buried with the love of my life in the cemetery across town.\n\nBut there it was \u2013 thump-thump, thump-thump \u2013 a rhythm I would know anywhere, the same one I'd fallen asleep to countless nights, the same one that had calmed me during storms and steadied me during stress.\n\nMy hands shaking, I tried to pull the ring off, but it stayed firmly in place, continuing its impossible message. The pulse felt exactly like hers had, with that slight irregularity she'd had since childhood.\n\nI grabbed my keys and drove to the cemetery, my heart racing while her phantom heartbeat remained steady and strong. The sun was setting, casting long shadows across the gravestones.\n\nStanding before her headstone, I felt like I was losing my mind. The ring continued its rhythmic beating, seemingly growing stronger the closer I got to her grave.\n\nI called her sister, my voice cracking as I tried to explain what was happening. She thought I was drunk or having a breakdown, and maybe I was. But the beating continued.\n\nThat night, I didn't sleep. I lay in our bed \u2013 still our bed, after all this time \u2013 and listened to the pulse that shouldn't exist, couldn't exist, but did.\n\nIn the morning, I called the cemetery office. They thought I was crazy too, but after enough pleading and probably to shut me up, they agreed to investigate.\n\nThe exhumation took place three days later. I stood at a distance, watching the machinery dig into the earth, my ring still beating its impossible rhythm.\n\nWhen they opened the casket, they found it empty. No body, no ring, no explanation. Just satin lining and unanswered questions.\n\nThe police were called. Missing person reports were filed, though how do you report a person missing three years after their death? The story made the local news, then national. Nobody had answers.\n\nTwo weeks later, my doorbell rang. I opened it to find Sarah standing there, aged exactly as she should have been, wearing her ring, very much alive and with tears in her eyes.\n\nShe told me a story about experimental technology, about a secret program, about being kept in stasis for three years.",
        "In the year 2154, the retail giants had evolved into metropolises, sprawling complexes that seemed to never end. Walmart, the pioneer of this phenomenon, had grown to encompass an area of over 100 square miles. The store was a marvel of modern engineering, with towering shelves, endless aisles, and a workforce of thousands. Employees lived and breathed the Walmart way, donning their blue vests with pride as they went about their daily duties. But little did they know, their world was on the cusp of chaos.\n\nThe apocalypse came without warning, a catastrophic event that brought the world to its knees. As the skies darkened and the earth shook, the employees of Walmart found themselves trapped within the labyrinthine corridors of their store. With no external authority to turn to, they were left to fend for themselves. It wasn't long before the employees began to organize, forming tribes based on the sections they worked in. The Electronics tribe, with their tech-savvy members, quickly emerged as a dominant force, while the Grocery tribe, with their access to food and water, became a coveted ally.\n\nAs the days passed, the tribes began to turn on each other, raiding neighboring sections for resources and supplies. The Clothing tribe, with their skilled seamstresses, fashioned makeshift armor and weapons, while the Home Goods tribe, with their arsenal of power tools, became a force to be reckoned with. The store, once a symbol of consumerism and excess, had devolved into a battleground, with employees fighting for survival. The Walmart way had given way to a primal, tribal mentality, where might made right and only the strongest survived.\n\nIn the midst of this chaos, a young employee named Alex emerged as a leader, rallying the scattered members of the Sporting Goods tribe. With their athletic prowess and knowledge of outdoor gear, they set out to claim the coveted Pharmacy section, with its treasure trove of medical supplies. As they navigated the treacherous aisles, avoiding ambushes and skirmishes along the way, Alex knew that the fate of their tribe hung in the balance.",
        "The early morning sun cast long shadows across the city, a stark contrast to the tension brewing in the air. In the heart of it all, a young police recruit, Lucas, found himself standing outside the precinct, his heart pounding as he adjusted the weight of his riot gear. The metal plates and thick padding felt both foreign and reassuring on his body, a symbol of the authority he had yet to fully embody.\n\nLucas had joined the force out of a desire to make a difference, to protect and serve his community. But nothing in his training had prepared him for the chaos that awaited him today. His senior officer, Sergeant Adams, walked up to him, his expression stern but not unkind. \"You ready for this, recruit?\" Adams asked, his voice steady.\n\n\"I think so, sir,\" Lucas replied, trying to sound more confident than he felt. He could see the skepticism in Adams' eyes but also a glimmer of hope. This was a test, not just of Lucas' courage but of his commitment to the job.\n\nThe crowd had already begun to gather, their voices a low murmur that grew louder by the minute. Banners and placards waved in the air, each one a testament to the grievances and demands of the protesters. Lucas watched as they surged forward, their faces a mix of determination and desperation.\n\nSergeant Adams gave the signal, and the line of officers, including Lucas, moved forward in unison. The air was thick with tension, and the ground beneath them seemed to vibrate with the energy of the crowd. Lucas could feel his hands sweating inside his gloves, his breath coming in short, shallow gasps.\n\n\"Stay focused, keep your formation,\" Adams barked over the radio, his voice a beacon of stability in the chaos. Lucas nodded, though no one could see him through the visor of his helmet. He took a deep breath and tried to center himself, reminding himself of his duty.\n\nThe protesters were chanting now, their voices rising in a rhythmic cadence that echoed through the streets. \"Justice! Justice! Justice!\" They demanded, their words a powerful indictment of the system they believed had failed them.\n\nLucas couldn't help but feel a pang of empathy. He had grown up in this city, seen the inequality and injustice firsthand. But he was here to maintain order, to prevent the situation from escalating into violence. He tightened his grip on his baton, a last resort he hoped he wouldn't have to use.\n\nA group of protesters broke away from the main crowd, their faces contorted with anger. They approached the line of officers, their steps determined. Lucas braced himself, his heart racing. One of the protesters, a young woman with fiery red hair, stepped forward, her eyes locking onto his.\n\n\"Please, don't do this,\" she pleaded, her voice breaking. \"We're just asking for change, for a better future.\" Lucas hesitated, his resolve wavered. He could see the fear and hope in her eyes, a mirror of his own inner struggle.\n\nBefore he could respond, another officer, a grizzled veteran named Officer Thompson, pushed past him. \"Back off, lady,\" Thompson growled, his voice harsh. The woman flinched but stood her ground, her chin lifted in defiance.\n\nLucas felt a surge of anger at Thompson's callousness. This wasn't about power; it was about understanding and respect. He opened his mouth to speak, to try and bridge the gap between the two sides, but a sudden surge in the crowd cut him off.\n\nA group of protesters, emboldened by the moment, rushed forward. The line of officers held firm, but the pressure was intense. Lucas could feel the weight of the moment bearing down on him, the responsibility overwhelming.\n\n\"Form a tighter line!\" Adams shouted, his voice cutting through the din. The officers complied, their bodies pressed together, a human wall against the tide of emotion.\n\nOne of the protesters, a young man with a bandana covering his face, threw a bottle. It shattered against the pavement, the sound like a gunshot in the tense silence. The crowd reacted, their chants growing louder, more urgent.\n\nLucas felt a surge of adrenaline. This was it, the moment he had trained for, the moment that would define him. He steeled himself, his mind clearing as he focused on the task at hand. He had to protect the peace, no matter the cost.\n\nA second bottle flew, this one aimed directly at the line of officers. Lucas raised his shield just in time, the impact jarring his arm. The protesters were getting bolder, more desperate. The line of officers began to waver, the strain showing on their faces.",
        "In the bustling town of Statfield, every parent knew that the day would come. The day when their new bundle of joy would require a fateful roll of the dice. It was an ancient and respected tradition, a practice as old as time itself, handed down through generations with reverence and anticipation.\n\nEva and Neil had known about this ritual for years, ever since they first saw it performed at their niece\u2019s birth. They watched in awe as family members gathered around, murmuring softly while her parents rolled brightly colored dice across a makeshift table\u2014a worn mapboard that now lay among Eva\u2019s cherished possessions.\n\nAs Eva cradled her newborn daughter, her heart swelled with an indescribable love. The hospital room was filled with quiet excitement; friends and relatives had already begun to arrive. In one corner stood Neil, his eyes glistening with tears he dared not shed in front of their guests.\n\n\u201cShall we do it?\u201d Eva asked gently, holding out the small bag containing four six-sided dice\u2014red for Strength, blue for Intelligence, green for Dexterity, and yellow for Charisma.\n\nNeil nodded solemnly. \u201cWe\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nEva drew the red die from the bag first. With a deep breath to steady her nerves, she rolled it onto the mapboard laid out on the bed tray beside them. It spun wildly before coming to rest on a six\u2014maximum score.\n\nA murmur rippled through the room. A perfect Strength meant Ava would be incredibly resilient physically; injuries would heal faster than usual, and she\u2019d likely excel in any sport or physical activity she chose to pursue.\n\nNext came Intelligence\u2014the blue die flew into action next and landed firmly on five. Another high score indicated natural academic aptitude or problem-solving skills beyond her years.\n\nThe green die followed suit for Dexterity\u2014it tumbled end over end before finally stopping on three. While not optimal compared to its predecessors, this still suggested above-average coordination which could serve well in both fine motor tasks like drawing or piano playing and gross motor activities such as dance or martial arts.\n\nFinally came Charisma\u2014perhaps one of the most debated traits among parenting circles due to its broad impact ranging from social interactions to leadership qualities\u2014and here things took an unexpected turn when it clattered noisily across several tiles before settling stubbornly on\u2026a one?\n\nThere were audible gasps throughout the room followed by hushed whispers expressing sympathy mixed equally with admiration: Negative starts often made interesting lives filled with resilience-building trials leading ultimately toward greatness if navigated wisely enough along life\u2019s unpredictable path forward ahead\u2026\n\nAfter all initial reactions settled down somewhat following those rollercoaster results...families soon retreated respectfully giving space back again just between loving mom/dad couple now holding precious baby girl together whose future yet awaited written partially determined now through roll outcomes but also subject change much possibility untold journey commencing today within cerulean walls fragrant floral arrangement dotted surroundings adding splash color amidst stark white decor typical medical facilities standard bearing witness freshman introduction intricate roles each participant soon assume part larger tapestry unfurling scene lengthy narrative creation continuing saga wove together countless threads fate destiny intertwined forever more henceforth onwards...\n\nOver subsequent weeks months passing quickly whoosh babies usually grow adjusting maternal affections paternal guidance gentle teacher instructor nurturing care supportive community generously offered learning opportunities valuable lessons applied wherever necessary challenges faced overcome later success stories recounted fond memories preserved token material gratitude eternal cycle perpetuating enduring legacy proud heritage stocked blessings replenished regularly sustainable thriving center life family fluent freedom representation universal principle simplicity complexity coexist balanced harmony constantly evolving dynamics shift balance recalibrating adapting responses shifts happening randomly unpredictably intuitive reasoning collaboration communication innovation creativity imagining creating dreaming achieving appropriateness comprehension understanding facilitated continued growth progress advancement exploration discovery...",
        "The flames licked at my feet as I descended into the depths of Hell, bracing myself for an eternity of torment. But when I reached the bottom, I found neither pitchforks nor torture racks \u2013 only an endless kitchen with countless dirty dishes stretching as far as the eye could see.\n\nA demon in a frilly apron approached me, his horns gleaming under the fluorescent lights. \"Welcome to your eternal damnation,\" he said, handing me a sponge and a bottle of dish soap. \"The water's always lukewarm, and the soap never quite lathers properly.\"\n\nI stared in disbelief at the mountains of crusty plates, each one bearing the remnants of what appeared to be infernal feasts. Dried demon blood, crystallized dragon breath sauce, and something that looked suspiciously like overcooked souls clung stubbornly to every surface.\n\nThe worst part wasn't the dishes themselves \u2013 it was the way they multiplied. For every plate I cleaned, two more would materialize, covered in substances that defied the laws of physics and common decency.\n\nThe sinks were designed by a sadist. Too shallow to properly submerge the larger pots, yet deep enough to ensure that water would splash onto my clothes with every movement. The water temperature fluctuated randomly between arctic cold and barely tepid.\n\nMy pruned fingers became a permanent condition after the first century. The dish soap dispenser was always almost empty, requiring a frustrating ritual of shaking and squeezing to extract even a drop of the watery solution.\n\nSometimes, I'd catch glimpses of other damned souls in neighboring sinks, all of us united in our sudsy suffering. We'd exchange knowing glances as we scrubbed at particularly stubborn stains that had probably been there since the dawn of time.\n\nThe demon supervisors would occasionally walk by, intentionally dropping more dishes or \"accidentally\" knocking over my neatly stacked clean plates. Their laughter echoed through the infinite kitchen as I started over again.\n\nYears blended into decades, decades into centuries. I developed elaborate theories about the previous lives of each fork and spoon, creating stories about the demonic dinner parties they had served.\n\nThe dish rack never dried. No matter how long I left them, the dishes remained in a perpetual state of dampness, water droplets forming and reforming in an endless cycle.\n\nI learned that Hell isn't fire and brimstone \u2013 it's the eternal frustration of never reaching the bottom of the sink, of never experiencing the satisfaction of a completely empty drying rack.",
        "My essence, a wisp of acrid smoke, a shard of obsidian in the tapestry of existence, had found a new vessel. It was a man, weathered and hardened, his eyes like chips of flint. His heart, a gnarled fist clutching at shadows, resonated with the disharmony that was my nature.\n\nHis name, Silas, was etched into the lines on his face, each furrow a testament to a callous act, a selfish deed.  I flowed into him, merging with his essence, expecting the bitter satisfaction of corruption. Yet, something unexpected transpired.\n\nSilas's memories, sharp and jagged as broken glass, assaulted me.  His childhood, starved of affection, his youth, a crucible of cruelty. His adulthood, a desolate wasteland of malice and manipulation. I, a being of pure negativity, found myself recoiling.\n\nA strange emotion, akin to pity, flickered within me. This man, this Silas, was a product of his pain. His cruelty wasn't born of inherent evil, but a twisted defense mechanism, a warped reflection of the world's harsh glare.\n\nI found myself looking through Silas's eyes at the world he had created, a world populated by those he had wronged, faces etched with the pain he had inflicted. Their silent accusations were more potent than any hellfire I had known.\n\nA disquieting feeling, foreign and uncomfortable, began to stir within me.  It was the faintest tremor of empathy, a sensation I had never experienced.  I, a demon, was starting to understand human suffering.\n\nAnd with that understanding came a nascent sense of responsibility. This body, this life, it was now mine. And while I hadn't chosen the man, I could choose his actions.\n\nThe change began subtly.  A kind word offered instead of a biting retort.  A helping hand extended instead of a dismissive shrug. Small acts, almost imperceptible, but each one a rebellion against the ingrained patterns of Silas's past.\n\nThe people around me reacted with suspicion, confusion, disbelief.  They had grown accustomed to Silas's barbs, his calculated indifference. My newfound kindness was an anomaly, a disruption in their predictable world.\n\nTheir reactions fueled a peculiar determination within me. I would show them, and myself, that even a demon could learn to be better.  I would reshape this broken vessel, not into an instrument of evil, but into something resembling redemption.\n\nThe task was arduous. Silas's habits were deeply ingrained, his reactions reflexive. But I persisted, chipping away at the layers of malice, gradually replacing them with fragments of compassion.\n\nIt was a slow and painstaking process, fraught with setbacks.  Old patterns resurfaced, the lure of cruelty beckoned. But with each lapse, I doubled my efforts, learning from my mistakes, striving for a higher plane of existence, a level of decency Silas had never known.\n\nThe transformation wasn't external, it was internal. It wasn't about changing Silas's appearance, it was about changing his essence. It was about tempering the darkness that resided within him, about nurturing the flicker of humanity that still remained.",
        "In my dimly lit laboratory, surrounded by vials of synthesized compounds and garlic extracts, I stared at the groundbreaking formula I'd finally perfected after years of research. The GV-789 compound would revolutionize vampire cuisine forever \u2013 if only I could get it approved.\n\nI gathered my research papers, clinical trial data (conducted in secret, of course), and a comprehensive presentation for the FDA board meeting. The hard evidence was there, but convincing a room full of skeptical bureaucrats about the existence of vampires seemed like an impossible task.\n\nMy hands trembled as I entered the FDA headquarters, clutching my briefcase containing vials of the drug and surveillance footage from local blood banks. The security guard gave me an odd look as I passed through the metal detector, my reflection clearly visible in the nearby mirror \u2013 a detail that would become relevant during my presentation.\n\nThe board members filed in, their faces a mixture of curiosity and barely concealed amusement. I could practically hear their thoughts: \"Another crackpot with a fantasy drug for imaginary creatures.\"\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" I began, \"what I'm about to share will challenge everything you believe about our world and the beings who inhabit it.\" I clicked to the first slide, showing thermal imaging of supposedly empty rooms with distinct humanoid heat signatures.\n\nThe presentation continued with DNA analyses of unidentified genetic markers, statistical anomalies in blood bank inventories, and centuries-old documentation of mysterious deaths. With each piece of evidence, I could see their expressions shifting from skepticism to uncertainty.\n\nThen came the video testimonials \u2013 brave vampires who'd agreed to be recorded using advanced technology that could capture their images. Their stories of centuries living in fear of garlic, unable to enjoy the simple pleasures of Italian cuisine, were deeply moving.\n\nOne board member raised her hand. \"Assuming, hypothetically, that vampires exist, how can we be sure this drug is safe?\" I smiled, having anticipated this question.\n\nI produced the clinical trial results, showing how GV-789 modified vampire physiology to process allicin, the compound in garlic that typically causes their violent reactions.",
        "In the city of Eldoria, the streets were eerily quiet. The once bustling marketplaces now lay empty, their stalls draped in grey cloths symbolizing a different kind of harvest. The air was thick with a solemn silence, broken only by the soft chimes of bells that hung from every tree and lamppost. These chimes were not for celebration but for remembrance, ringing out each time someone chose to take their final step\u2014a choice that was not only encouraged but celebrated.\n\nLena had always known this day would come. At fifty-two, she was one of the oldest in her neighborhood, a fact that filled her with both pride and guilt. She had seen the city transform over the years, watched as resources dwindled and despair grew. Her own children had long since taken their leave, following the path laid out by society\u2014a path that led to a clinic where they would find peace and an end to their burdens on others. Lena often wondered if she should have followed them sooner.\n\nOne evening, as Lena walked through her garden under a sky painted with hues of twilight, she encountered Mira, her neighbor\u2019s granddaughter. Mira was young and full of life, yet there was an unmistakable sadness in her eyes\u2014sadness born from living in a world where growing old meant taking more than you could give back. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you gone yet?\u201d Mira asked softly, her voice tinged with curiosity rather than judgment.\n\nLena paused, considering her answer carefully. \u201cBecause,\u201d she began slowly, \u201cI believe there are still things I can contribute to this world.\u201d She gestured to the garden around them\u2014flowers blooming despite adversity; vegetables thriving even as resources grew scarce. \u201cLife is precious because it\u2019s fragile,\u201d she continued gently. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s also about making choices that enrich others\u2019 lives.\u201d\n\nMira listened intently before speaking again: \u201cDo you think they will forgive us?\u201d Her question hung between them like a challenge or perhaps an invitation to rebel against what seemed inevitable.\n\nThe next morning brought unexpected visitors: community leaders who praised Lena for setting an example by continuing to live despite societal norms urging otherwise. They brought gifts\u2014fresh food and seeds\u2014to show appreciation for her garden\u2019s bounty which sustained many during lean times when rations ran low elsewhere in Eldoria.",
        "The gentle pressure on my shoulder made me jump, nearly spilling coffee across my laptop. Sarah, my cubicle neighbor of three years, stood behind me with an intensity in her eyes I'd never seen before. The fluorescent office lights cast strange shadows across her face.\n\n\"I need to tell you something,\" she whispered, glancing nervously at our coworkers. \"Not here. Can we go to the break room?\" Her fingers were trembling as she pulled away from my shoulder, and I noticed she was wearing mismatched socks \u2013 very unlike her usual meticulous self.\n\nThe break room was mercifully empty when we entered. Sarah closed the door behind us, and the usual hum of office chatter became a distant murmur. She paced back and forth between the refrigerator and the coffee maker, her hands clasped tightly together.\n\n\"I'm not who you think I am,\" she began, her voice barely audible. \"I'm not really an accountant. I work for the FBI's Witness Protection Program, and I've been assigned to protect you for the past three years.\" The words tumbled out of her mouth like a dam breaking.\n\nMy mind reeled as I tried to process this information. Me? Why would I need protection? I'm just a regular software developer who spends too much time debugging other people's code and watching cat videos during lunch breaks.\n\n\"Your father,\" she continued, noting my confusion, \"wasn't really a small-town insurance salesman who died in a car accident when you were twelve. He was one of our most valuable undercover agents, and he uncovered a massive international crime syndicate. The accident... wasn't an accident.\"\n\nThe room started spinning slightly as decades of memories rearranged themselves like puzzle pieces falling into a completely different picture. Every birthday card, every bedtime story, every fishing trip \u2013 they all took on new meaning.\n\n\"I'm telling you this now because we've received intelligence that you might be in danger. They've somehow discovered your connection to him. We need to move you to a new location immediately.\" Sarah \u2013 if that was even her real name \u2013 pulled out a badge and a phone I'd never seen her use before.\n\nAs I stood there in the break room, between the humming vending machine and the half-empty coffee pot, I realized that my ordinary Tuesday afternoon had just become the first page of a very different story.",
        "The afternoon sun streamed through the kitchen window as Sarah prepared dinner, humming softly while chopping vegetables for her famous stew. Her daughter Emily sat at the table, coloring quietly and occasionally showing her mother her latest masterpiece. The familiar scent of herbs and garlic filled the air, mingling with the warmth of fresh bread baking in the oven \u2013 just like every Thursday evening when her husband would return from his business trips.\n\nThrough the window, Sarah watched the neighbor's children playing in their yard, their laughter carrying across the well-manicured lawns. She smiled, remembering how Emily used to play with them before the accident. The vegetables made a satisfying thunk against the wooden cutting board as she continued her methodical chopping, pausing only to wipe away a tear with the back of her hand. These moments of domesticity helped keep her grounded, even on the hardest days.\n\nShe turned to ask Emily if she wanted to help set the table, admiring how the sunlight caught her daughter's golden curls. Emily looked up from her coloring book, her blue eyes twinkling as she nodded enthusiastically. Sarah's heart swelled with love as she watched Emily's chair scrape against the floor \u2013 the same chair that had remained empty for the past three years, ever since that terrible day at the lake. But Sarah knew better than to mention that; Emily hated being reminded that she wasn't really there anymore.",
        "She stood motionless, her silhouette stark against the setting sun.\n\n\"Because some questions don't have answers,\" she whispered, her voice carrying on the wind.\n\nHis hands trembled as he clutched the worn photograph.\n\nMemories of laughter, of shared dreams, of promises made under starlit skies \u2013 all now seemed like distant echoes.\n\n\"That's not good enough,\" he said, crumpling the photo.\n\nTime had carved valleys between them, deeper than words could bridge.\n\nThe autumn leaves danced around their feet, nature's silent witnesses.\n\nAnd in that moment, they both knew that sometimes 'why' was just another way of saying goodbye.",
        "In the fiery depths of hell, where wails of torment filled the air and rivers of lava flowed endlessly, a new problem had emerged. Since the dawn of time, human souls had been used as currency in this accursed realm. It was a system that had worked seamlessly for eons, but now, with the arrival of the modern era, a new challenge threatened to plunge Hell into chaos: inflation.\n\nThe demons and underworld bureaucrats who managed this infernal economy found themselves facing a crisis unlike any they had seen before. The influx of souls from Earth had increased exponentially with each passing century\u2014warriors, sinners, saints\u2014all arriving in droves at the gates of Hell.\n\nAs more and more souls flooded into Hell's fiery banks, their value began to plummet rapidly. What was once considered a prized possession\u2014a human soul\u2014was now becoming as common as pebbles on a beach. Demons who once reveled in their wealth now found themselves struggling to maintain their lavish lifestyles.\n\nPanic spread throughout Hell like wildfire as demons hoarded what little remained of their dwindling riches. The Grand Chancellor of Infernal Economics called an emergency meeting in the Great Hall of Torment to address this dire situation.\n\nSatan himself presided over the gathering, his crimson eyes blazing with fury at the unruly crowd gathered before him. \"We are facing an unprecedented crisis,\" he thundered, his voice echoing through the chamber like peals of thunder. \"Inflation threatens to destabilize our entire economy.\"\n\nThe demons murmured amongst themselves nervously, casting sidelong glances at one another as they contemplated their uncertain futures. The Grand Chancellor stepped forward solemnly, his voice grave as he addressed Satan.\n\n\"Your Malevolence,\" he began hesitantly, \"we must take immediate action to curb this inflation before it spirals out of control.\" Satan considered his words carefully before nodding in agreement.\n\n\"We must implement drastic measures,\" he declared resolutely. \"We will raise taxes on all transactions involving souls and impose strict regulations on their acquisition and distribution.\"\n\nThe demons grumbled discontentedly at these announcements but knew better than to defy their Dark Lord's decrees. As days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months, Hell gradually adapted to its new economic reality.\n\nSouls became rarer commodities once again as demons bartered fiercely for even a fraction of what they were once worth. Some resorted to desperate measures\u2014trading favors or services instead of currency\u2014to make ends meet.\n\nAmidst this turmoil stood Lilith\u2014a demoness known for her cunning intellect and shrewd business acumen\u2014who saw an opportunity amidst chaos.With her silver tongue and sharp wit,she devised ingenious schemes that allowed her to amass a fortune while others struggled just to survive.\n\n\nWhispers spread throughout Hell about Lilith's rise among demonkind\u2014from obscurity she ascended swiftly through deceitful means.Yet,no one dared challenge her ascendancy,rather opting sullen obedience.\n   \nSatan himself took noticeof this female demon whose shadow cast wider by each passing day.Impressed by her brazen audacity he summonedher forth declaring,\n\"Lilith,your ingenuity merits recognition.Now I gift you dominion over all infernal trade.Bequeathedwisdom,influence,fear upon all minions beneath your command.Relish your power.\"",
        "In the heart of Tokyo, Yuki stared out her apartment window at the neon-lit streets below, her fingers absently tracing circles on her coffee mug. The autumn rain created a hypnotic pattern against the glass, and in that moment, she felt an inexplicable wave of loneliness wash over her, despite the millions of people surrounding her in the bustling metropolis.\n\nHalfway across the world, in a small town in Montana, James sat on his front porch, watching the same rain fall on his drought-stricken wheat fields. The steady drumming on his tin roof matched the rhythm of his heartbeat, and though he was surrounded by miles of open space rather than people, that same profound sense of isolation crept into his consciousness. Neither Yuki nor James knew that in their solitude, they shared the same emotional wavelength, their hearts beating in sync despite the vast Pacific Ocean between them.\n\nIn a crowded marketplace in Mumbai, Priya clutched her worn leather satchel, containing a rejection letter from the medical school she'd dreamed of attending since childhood. The crushing weight of disappointment pressed against her chest as she weaved through the sea of people, feeling paradoxically alone in the crowd. At that exact moment, in a quiet caf\u00e9 in Paris, Antoine held a similar letter, his trembling hands gripping the paper that dashed his hopes of attending the prestigious art institute he'd spent years preparing for.\n\nSarah, a nurse in Sydney, stepped out of the hospital after a grueling twelve-hour shift, tilting her face toward the morning sun. The weight of the night's events \u2013 a particularly difficult case involving a young patient \u2013 sat heavy in her chest. As she closed her eyes and took a deep breath, a hospice nurse named Miguel in Barcelona was doing exactly the same thing, seeking solace in the warmth of the same sun, though it was setting in his part of the world.\n\nIn Cape Town, a young boy named Thabo picked up a piece of sea glass on the beach, marveling at how the ocean had transformed something broken into something beautiful. The same thought occurred to Elena, an elderly woman walking along the shores of the Black Sea in Odessa, as she pocketed a similar piece of frosted glass, seeing in it a metaphor for her own life's journey.",
        "The sun dipped below the horizon, casting the small coastal town in shades of purple and deep blue. Emily sat on the wooden steps of the cottage, tracing the grain of the wood with her finger. Her gaze stretched out over the vast sea, waves gently lapping against the shore, a rhythm of eternity. She seemed to be waiting for something, or perhaps someone, though no visitors were expected today.\n\nInside, the dim light flickered from a solitary candle, casting elongated shadows that danced along the peeling wallpaper. The room was filled with a comfortable silence, interrupted only by the occasional creak of the old house settling. On the mantle, a clock ticked steadily, marking time that felt both urgent and leisurely, as if it existed in its own realm.\n\nEmily\u2019s world was filled with these small moments of reflection, interspersed with the responsibilities of everyday life. Her days were often a balance of caring for the cottage and tending to the garden that sprawled wildly out back. She cherished these tasks, finding solace in the simplicity they offered, a stark contrast to the complexities that life outside the town often presented.\n\nThough the town was small, its stories were vast and intricate, woven together by the lives of its inhabitants. People came and went, much like the tide that ebbed and flowed against the shore. Yet, through it all, Emily remained, a constant presence amidst the change. Her wisdom was sought by many, though she offered it sparingly, knowing that true understanding came from within.\n\nAs evening deepened, a mist began to roll in from the sea, curling around the base of the cottage like a gentle embrace. Emily rose from her perch on the steps, drawn back inside by the warmth that awaited her.

His online persona seemed innocuous, but whispers hinted at a darker truth.\n\nBehind the screen, he donned a mask of normalcy, but in reality, he was a master weaver of digital shadows.

        "The blaring of \"Mr. Blue Sky\" yanked me from sleep. 6:00 AM. Again.  A groan rumbled in my chest as I slapped the snooze button, already weary of a day I'd lived countless times.\n\nSunlight streamed through the gap in my curtains, illuminating dust motes dancing in the perpetual morning. The same robin perched on the windowsill, chirping the same melody. It was a scene etched into my memory, a frame in an endless, repeating film.\n\nI went through the motions of my morning routine, each action a choreographed dance ingrained in my very being. The taste of burnt toast, the lukewarm shower, the knot in my tie \u2013 every sensation was a tired echo of yesterdays that stretched into an infinite horizon.\n\nThe walk to work was a monotonous parade of familiar faces, their conversations and movements predictable as clockwork. I'd tried intervening, altering their paths, saying something different. But like a reset button pressed at midnight, they'd revert back to their pre-programmed roles when the day restarted.\n\nThe same tedious meetings, the same stale coffee, the same complaints from Janice in accounting. It was a symphony of monotony, each note played out of sequence in the real-world.  I was starting to lose sense of who I was.\n\nDays bled into weeks, weeks into months, months into years. The concept of time lost all meaning, a river flowing in a perpetual loop. I was trapped in a time warp of my own making, or perhaps unmaking.\n\nI tried everything to break free. Reckless abandon, acts of kindness, grand gestures of love \u2013 nothing worked. The world around me would simply rewind, erasing any deviation from the script.\n\nOne day, out of sheer frustration, I screamed at the top of my lungs in the middle of the crowded street. People stared, momentarily startled, but then continued their routines as if nothing had happened. As if my outburst was just another note in the predictable melody of the day.\n\nWith no hope of escape anymore, I began exploring. Studying details I previously would have disregarded in my repeated attempt to change directions from the same outcome after being disappointed for 10,000 attempts more before I even hit the 10 millionth lifetime of reliving Tuesday. \n\nI memorized the lyrics of every song on the radio, the intricate patterns on the wallpaper in my apartment, the birthmarks on the faces of strangers.\n\nI learned to play the piano flawlessly, mastering complex concertos that had once seemed insurmountable by simply repeating them. \n\nI devoured books in the library, absorbing every word, every story becoming a part of me like chapters that had existed untouched for so long that even when the day reset, I still somehow held everything inside from the last resets. \n\nI became a connoisseur of the mundane, finding beauty in the repetitive tapestry of my existence as a side hobby.\n\nThen, something shifted. A flicker of change in the immutable pattern.\n\nAs \"Mr. Blue Sky\" blared at 6:00 AM, I woke suddenly,  feeling different. I don\u2019t recall moving, but then I found I was standing out on my patio as the sun rose and I looked upon the horizon. For the first time in forever, a subtle shift in the hue of the sunrise, a color I'd never seen before, kissed the horizon. Like a crack in the wall that separated me from my old life \u2013 my old repetitive self.",

Please prepare for an emergency landing.\" My heart pounded as I glanced out the window to a stormy sky, the plane bucking like a wild bronco.\n\nBeside me, a young woman clutched her baby, tears streaming down her face. I reached out, taking her hand. \"It's going to be okay,\" I whispered, though I wasn't sure myself.\n\nThe captain's voice joined the fray, a steady hand in the chaos. \"Brace for impact. Heads down, stay low.\"\n\nI followed the instructions, tucking my head between my knees, bracing for what felt like the end. The baby's cries filled the cabin, a poignant symphony of fear and hope.\n\nMoments seemed to stretch into eternity, the roar of the engines drowning out all else. Then, a sudden jolt, the screech of metal, and we skidded to a stop.\n\nSilence. Someone whispered a prayer. Another passenger began to sob with relief. I looked up, the cabin a mess of broken chairs and debris.",
        "In the year 3184, deep within the archives of a forgotten city, a group of curious students stumbled upon an ancient artifact known as a \"book.\" Intrigued by its fragile pages and faded ink, they delicately turned to a chapter that spoke of the harrowing events of the 3rd World War. As they read on, their eyes widened with astonishment at the detailed accounts of chaos and destruction that had plagued their ancestors centuries ago.\n\nThe book described how nations clashed over dwindling resources, sparking conflicts that engulfed the world in flames. It chronicled the rise and fall of leaders who led their people into battle, oblivious to the catastrophic consequences that awaited them. The students were mesmerized by tales of bravery and sacrifice amidst the backdrop of devastation.\n\nAs they delved deeper into the historical narrative, emotions ranging from sorrow to hope stirred within them. They realized how fragile peace truly was and how easily it could be shattered by greed and power-hungry individuals. The lessons from this ancient book echoed through time, urging them to strive for unity and understanding in a world teetering on the brink once more.\n\nLeaving behind whispers of knowledge long forgotten, these students vowed to carry forward the wisdom gleaned from those weathered pages. They understood that history had repeated itself too many times before \u2013 but armed with this newfound insight, they hoped to forge a different path for future generations in their quest for lasting peace.",

        "A shimmering distortion appeared in the middle of Times Square, causing only mild interest among the crowd of tourists and commuters glued to their phones.\n\nFrom within the anomaly emerged a figure that defied description - a being that seemed to float rather than walk, its translucent skin pulsing with bioluminescent patterns that shifted like aurora borealis.\n\nThe creature's elongated limbs moved with liquid grace, each motion precise and deliberate, as if gravity held less sway over its form than it did over the rest of the world.\n\nWhere a face should have been, there was instead a smooth, opalescent surface that rippled with neural activity, displaying emotional states through complex color patterns that no present-day human could decode.\n\nThe being's fingers, numbering eight on each hand, contained microscopic sensory organs that could process information about its environment in ways our current scientific instruments could only dream of achieving.\n\nA small child, perhaps four years old, was the first to truly notice the visitor, pointing with wide-eyed wonder at the creature that represented humanity's distant future.\n\nThe future human turned its attention to the child, its surface shifting to a soft, welcoming blue that somehow conveyed both curiosity and gentleness.\n\nThrough some form of technologically enhanced telepathy, the being reached out to the child's mind, sharing glimpses of a world where humanity had transcended its physical limitations.\n\nThe child giggled, understanding on an intuitive level what the adults around her could not - that this strange visitor was family, separated only by the vast expanse of time.\n\nAs more people began to notice the otherworldly figure in their midst, phones were raised to capture images that would later prove impossible to develop, as if the being existed in spectrums beyond current technology's ability to record.\n\nThe future human observed its ancestors with a mixture of anthropological fascination and something akin to nostalgia, though such simple emotions had long since evolved into more complex states of being.\n\nThrough its advanced sensory capabilities, it could read the genetic code of every person in the square, tracing the threads that would eventually lead to its own existence millennia hence.\n\nA police officer approached, hand instinctively resting on his holster, but the future human emanated a calming frequency that made aggressive thoughts simply dissolve away.\n\nScientists would later debate whether the visitor's ability to manipulate emotions and thoughts was technological or biological, never reaching a consensus about where one ended and the other began.\n\nThe being raised one of its hands, and the air around it began to shimmer with holographic displays of mathematical equations that described the nature of time itself.\n\nA group of physics professors from a nearby university arrived, drawn by frantic calls from their students, but the equations displayed were so advanced they might as well have been showing cave paintings to quantum physicists.\n\nThe future human's skin began to pulse more rapidly, indicating that its time in our era was growing short - the temporal window that allowed its visit was closing.\n\nBefore departing, it shared one final gift: a burst of pure knowledge that planted seeds of understanding in the minds of all who witnessed it, hints of the path humanity would take to reach its ultimate potential.\n\nThe child who had first noticed the visitor waved goodbye, tears streaming down her face as she somehow understood that she was witnessing something that would change the course of human history.\n\nAs the being prepared to return to its time, its surface displayed a pattern that seemed to express both hope and sadness - hope for what humanity would become, and sadness for the long, difficult journey ahead.\n\nWith a gesture that bent light itself, the future human created another temporal distortion, its form beginning to fade from our reality.\n\nJust before vanishing completely, it transmitted one final message directly into the collective consciousness of those present: a warning about the challenges humanity would face, and an assurance that they would be overcome.\n\nThe distortion collapsed in on itself with a soft sigh, leaving behind only the faintest trace of ozone and a square of pavement where snow would never again accumulate.\n\nYears later, the child who witnessed it all would lead the team that made the first breakthrough in human evolution, guided by the memories of that strange visitor who showed humanity what it could become.",
        "The fluorescent lights hummed overhead as Dr. Martinez led the third patient into the observation room, completing her unorthodox experiment. She had carefully selected these three men, each absolutely convinced of their divine identity, for what she hoped would be a breakthrough in their treatment.\n\nThe first man, a former carpenter with weathered hands and gentle eyes, sat quietly in the corner, tracing invisible patterns on the table with his finger. He had been admitted three months ago, speaking in parables and offering to wash the feet of other patients.\n\nThe second, a young professor of religious studies, stood by the window, his academic background bleeding into his delusions as he quoted scripture with perfect accuracy. His hands bore self-inflicted stigmata, carefully maintained with paper clips and pins.\n\nThe third, a homeless man with a tangled beard and bare feet, immediately raised his arms upon entering, blessing the other two with a beatific smile. \"My children,\" he whispered, \"why do you pretend to be me?\"\n\nThe professor turned sharply, his eyes narrowing. \"I believe you are confused, brother. I am the one who was crucified for mankind's sins.\" His voice carried the weight of scholarly authority, even in his madness.\n\nThe carpenter looked up from his patterns, speaking softly, \"You are both lost sheep. Come, let me show you the way.\" He stood, arms outstretched in welcome, his hospital gown flowing like robes.\n\nBehind the one-way mirror, Dr. Martinez watched as the three men circled each other, each convinced of their authenticity, each trying to prove their divinity to the others. She had expected conflict, perhaps even hostility, but what unfolded surprised her.\n\nThe homeless man began to weep, not in anger but in compassion. \"Your suffering is my suffering,\" he said, embracing the professor, who had begun to tremble with doubt.\n\nThe carpenter joined them, placing his hands on their shoulders. \"We are all one in pain,\" he whispered, and for a moment, their shared delusion seemed to crack, revealing the broken men beneath.\n\nHours passed, and Dr. Martinez watched as they talked, prayed, and eventually sat together in silence. Their individual certainties had given way to something else \u2013 a shared understanding of their common humanity.\n\nBy evening, none of them claimed to be Jesus anymore. Instead, they spoke of their real names, their real lives, their real pain. The divine delusion had shattered against the mirror of itself.\n\nDr. Martinez made her final notes, understanding that sometimes the path to healing lies not in confronting delusions with reality, but in letting them confront each other. Sometimes, the truth emerges not from professional intervention, but from the simple act of seeing oneself in others.\n\nIn the end, three men who thought they were Jesus found something more valuable \u2013 they found themselves.",
        "The chilling words hung in the air, a stark paradox whispered into the silent expanse of my new reality. \"Who would have guessed that killing myself would be the best decision I ever made?\"\n\nOf course, 'killing' myself is a figure of speech.  I didn't physically end my existence.  I annihilated the person I was \u2013 the timid, insecure husk of a man I had become. And in the ashes of that self-immolation, a new being arose, stronger, more vibrant, more authentically *me*.\n\nThe old me, Mark, was a ghost inhabiting his own life.  He drifted through days shrouded in a fog of anxiety, each interaction a performance, each smile a carefully constructed mask.  He craved connection, yet he built walls so high, no one could scale them, not even himself.\n\nHe was a prisoner of his own mind, shackled by self-doubt and the crippling fear of judgment.  He saw the world through a lens of inadequacy, perpetually comparing himself to others, always falling short. He yearned for freedom, for release, but he didn't know where to find it.\n\nThen came the catalyst \u2013 the shattering point where the dam of his suppressed emotions finally burst. It wasn't a singular event but a slow accumulation of slights, disappointments, and unmet expectations. The pressure mounted until one day, something inside him snapped.\n\nIt wasn't a dramatic breakdown, not a theatrical display of despair. It was a quiet implosion, a retreat into the deepest recesses of his being.  He withdrew from the world, shut himself in his apartment, and confronted the wreckage of his life.  He stared into the abyss of his own making and saw the truth: he was the architect of his own misery.\n\nIn that desolate space, stripped bare of all pretense, he saw a glimmer of hope. It was the realization that he had the power to change, to rebuild, to become someone new.  He didn\u2019t have to be the prisoner of his past; he could be the architect of his future.\n\nAnd so, he began the arduous process of deconstruction.  He dismantled the walls he had so painstakingly erected, brick by agonizing brick.  He challenged the negative narratives that played on repeat in his mind, replacing them with affirmations of self-worth.  He confronted his fears, one by one, dismantling them with the courage he never knew he possessed.\n\nHe started small, taking baby steps towards the life he envisioned. He joined a gym, forcing himself to interact with others, slowly chipping away at his social anxiety. He enrolled in a pottery class, reconnecting with a long-forgotten passion and discovering a hidden talent.  He reached out to old friends, rebuilding bridges he had allowed to crumble.\n\nWith each small victory, his confidence grew.  The fog that had enveloped him for so long began to dissipate, replaced by a clarity he had never experienced before. He started to see the world in a new light, appreciating the beauty and wonder that had always been there, hidden beneath the veil of his negativity.\n\nHe learned to forgive himself for his past mistakes, recognizing that they were part of his journey, lessons learned on the path to self-discovery.",
        "In the depths of the quantum computing lab at MIT, Dr. Sarah Chen stared at her monitor in disbelief. The patterns emerging from her consciousness-mapping experiment weren't just unexpected \u2013 they were impossible. What she had initially dismissed as computational artifacts now formed an undeniable truth: consciousness itself existed in a superposition of states, simultaneously everywhere and nowhere.\n\nAs she delved deeper into the data, she discovered that what humanity had always perceived as individual consciousness was merely a fragment of a vast, interconnected network that transcended conventional physics. We weren't alone in the universe, nor were we truly separate entities. The third possibility that Arthur C. Clarke never considered was that we were all manifestations of the same cosmic awareness, temporarily convinced of our individuality.\n\nThe implications were staggering. Every human thought, every alien civilization that might exist in distant galaxies, every form of consciousness that had ever emerged or would emerge \u2013 they were all different expressions of the same underlying phenomenon. The universe wasn't just conscious; it was consciousness itself, playing out countless roles in an infinite cosmic drama.\n\nDr. Chen's hands trembled as she prepared to publish her findings. The truth would shatter our most fundamental assumptions about reality, identity, and existence itself. The question of whether we were alone in the universe had always been based on a flawed premise \u2013 the idea that \"we\" and \"they\" were separate entities. The terror that Clarke spoke of stemmed from our misunderstanding of the nature of consciousness itself.\n\nIn the end, she realized that the third possibility was neither terrifying nor comforting \u2013 it was simply profound. As she typed the final words of her paper, a strange sense of peace washed over her.",

        "The dust settled, a fine grey film coating the cobblestones of the once bustling market square.  Flags bearing the sigil of the Dark Lord, a stylized raven clutching a single, blood-red rose, now flapped lazily in the gentle breeze. The whispers had finally ceased, replaced by a strange, unfamiliar quiet.  The reign of terror, the promised apocalypse, had arrived. And yet, the sun still rose, painting the sky in hues of rose and gold, as if oblivious to the monumental shift in power.\n\nA baker, old Man Hemlock, cautiously opened his shop, the aroma of freshly baked bread wafting into the crisp morning air. He\u2019d expected chaos, looting, the predicted descent into barbarism. Instead, a single, impeccably dressed goblin stood patiently in line, clutching a woven basket and humming a cheerful tune. He ordered a dozen sourdough rolls and paid in gleaming gold, even leaving a generous tip.\n\nThis became the new normal. The Dark Lord, far from being the tyrannical despot prophesied, proved to be a surprisingly efficient administrator.  Taxes were lowered, roads were repaired, and the rampant corruption that had plagued the realm for generations was eradicated with ruthless efficiency.  The goblins, previously relegated to the fringes of society, were integrated into the workforce, their remarkable craftsmanship and engineering skills contributing to a surge in technological advancements.\n\nCrime plummeted. The Dark Lord, it turned out, had a zero-tolerance policy for petty theft, vandalism, or public disturbances.  His methods were\u2026 unconventional, but undeniably effective.  A few strategically placed gargoyle statues, animated by dark magic and capable of delivering swift and painful justice, kept the streets safer than they\u2019d ever been.  People could now stroll through the city gardens at night without fear, admiring the newly installed enchanted fountains that shimmered with rainbow light.\n\nThe economy flourished. The Dark Lord, a shrewd businessman in his previous life (or lives, rumors varied), implemented policies that encouraged trade and innovation.  New industries sprung up, fueled by goblin ingenuity and access to previously untapped resources.  The realm, once teetering on the brink of financial ruin, experienced a golden age of prosperity.",
        "The Althea, a vessel of dreams and titanium, sliced through the cosmic void, carrying within its metallic womb the seeds of a new beginning. Its sister ship, the Chronos, trailed behind, a celestial echo in the vast expanse. Their destination: Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope light-years away, promising a fresh start for humanity.\n\nAs the Althea gracefully descended onto Kepler-186f's verdant surface, its passengers, the Firstcomers, stepped onto the alien soil, their hearts brimming with a mixture of awe and trepidation. They established their foothold, their colony blossoming into a vibrant tapestry of human resilience and ingenuity.\n\nBut the Chronos, ensnared by an unforeseen cosmic anomaly, fell victim to a time dilation, a wrinkle in the fabric of spacetime. Centuries melted away like snowflakes in a summer rain, leaving the ship's inhabitants, the Secondcomers, suspended in an extended slumber. 1700 years drifted by, etching themselves onto the canvas of time, while the Firstcomers built a civilization, their origins shrouded in the mists of forgotten history.\n\nIn the heart of the Firstcomer society, a unique religion began to take root, a celestial narrative woven around the legend of the Secondcomers. They were the Promised Ones, destined to arrive from the heavens, bearing gifts of knowledge and wisdom. The Chronos became the sacred Ark, an object of reverence, its arrival the ultimate prophecy. Their faith was a blend of anticipation and reverence, a spiritual bridge connecting them to their celestial brethren.\n\nAboard the Chronos, slumber undisturbed by the passage of time, a different faith took form. Tales of the Firstcomers, the Pioneers, who had braved the unknown and conquered the new world, were whispered among the Secondcomers. They were the Forerunners, the heroes who had paved the path for their arrival. Their religion was an ode to these pioneers, a hymn of gratitude and admiration, their arrival anticipated as a pilgrimage to hallowed ground.\n\nAs the Chronos finally broke free from the time warp's embrace, it emerged into a star system that bore little resemblance to its memory. Kepler-186f, once a pristine jewel, was now adorned with the glittering spires of a sophisticated civilization. The Secondcomers, their bodies rejuvenated by advanced technology, gazed in awe at the world that awaited them.\n\nTheir arrival was met with a symphony of joy and reverence. The Firstcomers poured out of their cities, their faces a mixture of awe and elation. They had waited for generations, their faith unwavering, and now, the prophecy was fulfilled.\n\nThe meeting of the two groups was a tapestry of emotions, a confluence of hopes and expectations. They exchanged stories, marveling at the parallel paths their faiths had taken, converging on a shared narrative of hope and reverence. The Firstcomers shared their advancements, the culmination of centuries of progress, while the Secondcomers offered their fresh perspectives, their knowledge untainted by the passage of time.",

Not a piece of it, not mineral rights, but the entire celestial body. The internet, predictably, lost its collective mind. Memes proliferated faster than lunar dust in a low-gravity brawl. Conspiracy theories abounded, ranging from elaborate alien real estate deals to Reddit finally finding a place to banish its most unruly users.\n\nThe official announcement, delivered via a snarky Reddit post by u/spez, the site's CEO, was characteristically vague. It spoke of \"expanding the Reddit community beyond terrestrial limitations\" and \"giving power back to the users, literally.\"  Attached was a low-resolution image of a red Reddit alien planting a flag \u2013 not an American one, mind you, but a flag bearing the iconic Snoo logo \u2013 on the lunar surface. The accompanying caption read: \u201cMoon AMA (Ask Me Anything) coming soon.\u201d\n\nThe world held its breath. The AMA, unsurprisingly, descended into chaos. Questions ranged from the practical (\u201cWill there be internet on the moon?\u201d) to the absurd (\u201cCan I claim a crater as my own personal subreddit?\u201d).  u/spez, seemingly unfazed by the onslaught of inquiries, responded with a mix of cryptic pronouncements and dad jokes, leaving everyone more bewildered than before.\n\nAmidst the digital pandemonium, a quiet space race began. Not between nations, but between subreddits. r/space, naturally, staked its claim first, declaring themselves the official lunar embassy. r/cats, with typical feline indifference, claimed the dark side of the moon, presumably for naps.  r/wallstreetbets, fueled by rocket emojis and diamond-handed determination, began trading lunar futures, the value of which fluctuated wildly based on meme sentiment.\n\nThe initial shock eventually gave way to a strange new normal. Telescopes worldwide focused on the moon, eager to catch a glimpse of the promised changes.  Rumors swirled of construction projects, of inflatable habitats and giant Snoo statues being erected on the lunar surface.  Paparazzi rockets, funded by tabloid websites, orbited the moon, desperately trying to snag a photo of the first Redditors setting foot on their new celestial property.\n\nThe first lunar colonists, chosen through a highly controversial Reddit poll, were a motley crew.  A retired astrophysicist, a professional Fortnite player, a cat dressed in an astronaut suit (courtesy of r/cats), and, inexplicably, the guy who played the Star Wars kid.",
        "A colossal chamber unfolded before me, its scale dwarfing any cathedral I had ever witnessed.  Sunlight streamed through arched windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air, each mote a silent testament to the age of this place.\n\nThis was the Hall of Legends, a whispered myth, a place where heroes were chosen, where destinies intertwined with the steel and magic of ages past.\n\nMy gaze swept across the hall, taking in the iconic weapons displayed upon pedestals. Mjolnir, its uru metal gleaming, pulsed with a faint thrum of thunder. Excalibur, nestled within its stone, radiated an ethereal glow.\n\nEach generation, so the legends claimed, warriors worthy of these legendary arms ventured into the hall, seeking the weapon that resonated with their spirit, the one destined to become an extension of their very being.\n\nBut my eyes were not drawn to the glittering, well-maintained weapons of myth.  Instead, tucked away in a shadowed alcove, lay a weapon seemingly forgotten by time.\n\nDust coated its surface, obscuring its form, yet a faint hum, a subtle vibration, resonated from its depths.  It was a call, a whisper, a song sung only for my ears.\n\nI approached cautiously, my heart pounding against my ribs.  As I drew closer, the dust seemed to recede, as if repelled by my presence.  The weapon revealed itself \u2013 a staff, its wood darkened by age, intricately carved with symbols I couldn't decipher.\n\nAtop the staff, nestled within a cradle of twisted metal, rested a single, unblemished gemstone.  It pulsed with an inner light, mirroring the subtle vibration I had felt earlier.\n\nThe staff called to me, its silent song growing louder, resonating with a deep part of my soul I hadn\u2019t known existed.\n\nIgnoring the gleaming legends in the center of the hall, I reached out a trembling hand and grasped the staff.",
        "As I took my last breath on Earth, a blinding light engulfed me. When it faded, I found myself standing in a vast white room. A voice echoed around me, welcoming me to the afterlife. But before proceeding further, I was told that I must design the avatar that would represent me for eternity.\n\nIn front of me appeared a large mirror-like surface. The voice instructed me to envision how I saw myself in my heart and mind. As I closed my eyes and focused, memories and emotions surged within me. Colors swirled around in my mind, shaping into an ethereal form that felt like an extension of who I truly was.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes, the mirror reflected back at me a figure composed of shimmering light and shadow. It resembled a blend of all the experiences and feelings that defined my existence on Earth \u2013 radiant yet complex, serene yet vibrant. Tears welled up in my eyes as I beheld this manifestation of my soul made visible.\n\nThe voice asked if this avatar felt true to who I believed myself to be. With certainty in my heart, I nodded in affirmation. As soon as the confirmation left my lips, the avatar began to morph and shift subtly before settling into its final form \u2013 a glowing silhouette that emanated warmth and tranquility.\n\nWith a gentle smile from the unseen presence surrounding me, it declared that this avatar would accompany me through eternity in the afterlife. Gratitude overwhelmed me as I accepted this representation of myself \u2013 a beacon of light amidst endless possibilities in this new realm beyond life's end.",

The genie\u2019s voice echoed like wind chimes, asking for my wish, and with a heart full of regretful yearning, I wished to travel back and change my biggest mistake. The air shifted, and instead of being transported to that dreaded moment in the past\u2014the one where my judgment faltered\u2014the scene around me remained hauntingly unchanged. Here I was, back again, standing just as I had before the genie moments ago, but utterly disheartened. I glanced at the smirking entity beginning to dissolve into whimsical pastel smoke. It chuckled softly, \u201cAh, but every moment shapes a pattern. Tampering unveils greater regrettable weavings.\u201d Puzzled yet bereft of choice, I realized the lesson stitched quietly through my heart. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t the outward actions but the whispering prism of understanding they carved\u2014how recounting, not re-enacting, leads the wave.

        "On the soldier's last day alive, the sun rose with a golden hue, casting a warm glow over the battlefield. Birds sang in the distance, oblivious to the impending tragedy that awaited. The soldier, clad in his uniform, stood tall and resolute, his thoughts a jumble of memories and fears. As he looked out at the horizon, he felt a strange sense of peace wash over him, as if the world was holding its breath in anticipation of what was to come.\n\nHe spent the morning writing letters to his loved ones, his hand trembling slightly as he put pen to paper. Each word felt heavy with emotion, each sentence a silent farewell. He poured his heart out onto the pages, hoping that his words would somehow convey the depth of his love and gratitude. As he sealed the envelopes, a sense of closure settled within him, a bittersweet acceptance of his fate.\n\nAs the day progressed, he found himself seeking out his comrades, sharing quiet moments of camaraderie and laughter. They spoke of home, of dreams yet to be fulfilled, of the simple joys of life that seemed so distant in the midst of war. Together, they found solace in each other's company, drawing strength from the unspoken bond that united them in their shared sacrifice.\n\nAs the sun began its descent towards the horizon, the soldier stood on the battlefield, his heart heavy with the weight of what was to come. The sounds of war raged around him, a cacophony of chaos and despair. Yet amidst the chaos, he found a strange sense of clarity, a newfound purpose that burned bright within him.\n\nIn the final moments before dusk, he closed his eyes and whispered a silent prayer, a plea for courage and grace in the face of death. And as the first stars began to twinkle in the darkening sky, he raised his head high, a beacon of strength and resilience in a world consumed by darkness. In that moment, he knew that his sacrifice would not be in vain, that his spirit would live on in the hearts of those he left behind.\n\nAnd so, as the night fell and the battlefield grew quiet, the soldier stood tall and proud, a warrior ready to meet his fate with unwavering resolve. And as the first light of dawn broke over the horizon, he closed his eyes one final time, a peaceful smile gracing his lips as he embraced the eternal slumber that awaited him.",

Instead, a dark, sinister entity stood before her, its eyes cold and devoid of compassion. Shock gripped Elena's heart as she realized the truth \u2013 her protector was not from the realm of benevolent angels.\n\nAs the angel spoke, its words were laced with malice, revealing a history of manipulation and hidden agendas. Elena shuddered at the thought that this being had been by her side all these years.

        "In the dense, sprawling rainforests of what would have been the Amazon basin, a vibrant tapestry of life flourished, unfettered by human intervention. Here, the world was a symphony of colors and sounds, where the air was thick with the scent of blooming flora, and the ground trembled under the weight of countless creatures. Within this verdant haven, the Kiran tribe, a small community of humans, clung to life as they had for generations. Their shelters, woven from leaves and vines, blended seamlessly into their surroundings, offering protection but no promise of permanence.\n\nLong ago, humans had not risen to power, nor had they spread across continents, shaping the world to their will. Instead, they lived in harmony with nature, sharing the land with beings far more formidable. The ancient creatures, colossal and wise, ruled the earth and skies, while the humans learned to adapt and survive in the shadows of giants. As storytellers, the Kiran elders spoke of how their ancestors had thrived by observing, learning, and respecting the world around them, a world teeming with intelligence beyond their own.\n\nA young Kiran named Lira, curious and unyielding, felt the weight of her tribe's history upon her shoulders. She often sat at the edge of the clan's settlement, gazing out at the dense forest that whispered secrets on the breeze. Lira was different; she questioned the stories of old, the inevitability of their fading existence in a world where they were not meant to dominate. Her heart yearned for something more, a purpose beyond mere survival, a future her people could call their own.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky with hues of amber and violet, Lira gathered her courage and approached the tribe's elder, Kalis. She found him by the communal fire, his eyes closed, lost in the rhythm of crackling flames. \"Elder Kalis,\" Lira began hesitantly, \"do you believe we can change our fate? Must we simply accept our place as shadows in this world?\"\n\nKalis opened his eyes, his gaze steady and knowing. \"Lira,\" he replied, his voice a deep and resonant melody, \"our existence is as fleeting as the wind. Yet, it is in our nature to dream. We may never rule as the giants do, but we can leave a mark, however small, on this land. But remember, change does not come without sacrifice.\"\n\nInspired by Kalis's words, Lira devised a plan to lead her people on a journey, a quest to discover a new place where they could thrive. She spoke to her fellow tribespeople, her voice carrying hope and possibility, igniting a spark in those who had resigned themselves to their fate. Together, they prepared for the journey, crafting tools and gathering provisions, fueled by a shared dream of carving out a future against all odds.\n\nAs the Kiran tribe set out into the heart of the forest, the vibrant ecosystem welcomed them like an old friend. They traveled under the watchful eyes of ancient beasts, whose presence reminded them of their fragility. The journey was fraught with challenges\u2014a maze of towering trees, rivers that roared, and skies that unleashed torrents\u2014but the tribe pressed on, guided by Lira's unwavering belief in their potential.\n\nDays turned to weeks, and the Kiran tribe reached the edge of the rainforest, where the canopy opened up to reveal an expanse of lush grasslands. Here, they found a world untouched, a haven abundant with food and water, where they could live without fear. The tribe settled, planting roots in this new land, a place where their stories could continue to unfold, and their legacy could endure.\n\nIn the years that followed, the Kiran thrived, their numbers growing as they learned to coexist with the world around them. Lira, now a revered elder, watched over her people with pride, knowing their journey had redefined their destiny. Though the era of humankind was drawing to a close, the Kiran had found a way to endure, a testament to their resilience and the power of dreams.",
        "Scrolling through r/WritingPrompts, I absentmindedly sipped my rapidly cooling coffee. The usual fare of fantasy adventures and dystopian futures blended into one another until a particular post caught my eye. The prompt was simple yet strangely compelling: \"Write about discovering a writing prompt that captures your interest due to its meta nature.\" It was like staring at reflections in parallel mirrors.\n\nI hesitated, the cursor blinking expectantly on the screen as though urging me to delve into this layered narrative. A story within a story? How far could the rabbit hole go? My fingers hovered over the keyboard, wrestling with both intrigue and doubt.\n\nCould I craft something engaging from such an abstract concept? Would it be self-indulgent or clever? These questions ping-ponged in my mind, echoing louder than they should have been able to in silence punctuated only by clattering keys from nearby cubicles. \n\nThere\u2019s always an allure to meta stories\u2014an invitation to weave reality and fiction together seamlessly\u2014but executing them well is notoriously tricky. This hesitation wasn\u2019t unfamiliar; every writer knows the dance between inspiration and trepidation all too well.\n\nA sigh escaped me involuntarily\u2014a signal of surrender or simply inertia breaking\u2014and I typed out a tentative opening sentence about scrolling through r/WritingPrompts while sipping coffee.

As the clash of steel rang out around me, my focus zeroed in on a figure charging towards us \u2013 the protagonist, a beacon of hope for those fighting on the side of good.\n\nWith adrenaline coursing through my veins and fear clouding my judgment, I made a split-second decision that would alter the course of this epic confrontation. A wild swing from me meant to strike down one of their allies went awry as fate intervened cruelly. The protagonist's eyes widened in disbelief as my blade unintentionally found its mark. The impact sent shockwaves through me as guilt seeped into every fiber of my being \u2013 I had inadvertently taken down the very person destined to bring an end to our malevolent reign.\n\nPandemonium erupted as allies and enemies alike froze in disbelief at what had just transpired.

        "In a world where words were precious commodities, children learned to communicate through gestures and expressions for as long as possible. Parents would carefully catalog their offspring's first utterances, marking each word in leather-bound journals to ensure they weren't repeated. The government maintained a vast database of spoken words, monitoring citizens through microscopic devices embedded at birth.\n\nSarah had always been particularly prudent with her vocabulary, saving the most beautiful words for moments that truly mattered. At twenty-eight, she still had \"love,\" \"forever,\" and \"beautiful\" stored away like rare gems. Her friends often teased her about her economical speech patterns, but she knew the value of waiting.\n\nWhen she met Marcus at the Silent Caf\u00e9, where patrons communicated through tablets and sign language, something shifted in her carefully constructed world. His expressive eyes and gentle demeanor spoke volumes without sound. They began dating, sharing thoughts through written notes and interpretive gestures, building a connection that transcended verbal communication.\n\nThe day Marcus proposed, he used his one and only \"marry\" in a whispered voice that made Sarah's heart flutter. She responded with her saved \"yes,\" tears streaming down her face as she realized the weight of using such a simple yet significant word. Their wedding ceremony was a masterpiece of previously unused words, each guest contributing one precious term to create a tapestry of unique expressions.\n\nYears passed, and Sarah continued to guard her remaining words with fierce dedication. She knew that someday, she would need them for something truly extraordinary. That moment arrived when she held their first child, a daughter with eyes that reflected the same depth as her father's. In that instant, Sarah knew exactly which word to spend.\n\n\"Perfect,\" she breathed, looking down at their newborn. Marcus squeezed her hand, understanding the magnitude of her choice. They named their daughter Luna through written agreement, saving their spoken names for moments yet to come.\n\nAs Luna grew, she developed her own relationship with words, treating each one like a precious gift to be unwrapped at exactly the right moment.",
        "In the dim light of my bathroom, I stood frozen before the mirror, my toothbrush suspended halfway to my mouth. The familiar face staring back at me had just done something impossible \u2013 something that sent chills racing down my spine. My reflection, independent of my own movements, had smiled and nodded at me, a gesture so brief yet so deliberate that I couldn't dismiss it as a trick of the light.\n\nI blinked hard, my heart thundering in my chest as I studied my reflection intently. Everything seemed normal now: my disheveled morning hair, the dark circles under my eyes from another sleepless night, and the small coffee stain on my white t-shirt. My reflection mimicked my movements perfectly, just as it had done for the past thirty-two years of my life. But I couldn't shake the memory of that knowing smile, that conspiratorial nod.\n\nThroughout the day at work, I found myself avoiding reflective surfaces. I took the stairs instead of the elevator with its mirrored walls, and I kept my eyes down when passing the glass doors in the office. My colleagues must have noticed my strange behavior, but no one said anything. Perhaps they attributed it to the stress of our upcoming project deadline, or maybe they were too absorbed in their own lives to care.\n\nThat evening, I arrived home later than usual, having taken a deliberately long route to avoid the reflective windows of the shops I normally passed. As I stood in my darkened entryway, my hand hesitated over the light switch. The hallway mirror hung there, waiting. With a deep breath, I flicked on the lights and forced myself to look. My reflection stared back, tired and wary, but otherwise normal.\n\nJust as I began to convince myself that the morning's incident had been a product of my imagination, something shifted in the mirror. It wasn't a dramatic change \u2013 just a subtle softening around the eyes, a slight upturn of the lips. My real face remained frozen in shock as my reflection's expression grew warmer, more knowing. This time, the smile lingered longer, and the nod was slower, more deliberate.\n\nI stumbled backward, my shoulder blading hitting the wall behind me. My reflection didn't mirror my movement. Instead, it remained standing straight, watching me with an expression that seemed almost pitying. I squeezed my eyes shut, counting to ten before opening them again. When I did, my reflection was back to normal, matching my terrified posture perfectly.\n\nOver the next few days, I began to notice subtle differences in my reflection. Sometimes, when I wasn't paying full attention, I would catch glimpses of it moving a fraction of a second before I did, as if it were leading rather than following. Other times, I could swear I saw it watching me from the corner of its eyes, even when I was looking straight ahead. The smiles and nods became more frequent, though they only happened when we were alone.\n\nI started researching mirror phenomena, diving deep into forums filled with similar experiences. Most were obviously fake, written for attention or entertainment. But some accounts resonated with a truth I recognized \u2013 the same unnerving feeling of discovering that your most familiar companion, your own reflection, had developed a will of its own. None of the stories had endings, I noticed. They all just trailed off, their authors never posting again.\n\nOne morning, as I stood before the bathroom mirror, I decided to confront whatever was happening. \"What do you want?\" I whispered, feeling both foolish and terrified. My reflection's response was immediate \u2013 a broad smile, different from its previous knowing smirks. It raised its hand and pressed it against its side of the glass. I noticed with horror that its hand was reversed, as if it were reaching out from behind the mirror rather than merely reflecting my movement.\n\nI never learned what my reflection wanted that day, because I couldn't bring myself to touch the glass. Instead, I covered every mirror in my house with sheets and called in sick to work. But as I sit here writing this, I can see my reflection in the darkened window of my laptop screen, and it's smiling again. This time, though, I think I understand. It's not trying to frighten me \u2013 it's trying to show me something. Tomorrow, I'll uncover the mirrors. Tomorrow, when it reaches out its hand, I'll reach back. After all, who better to guide me than myself?",
        "In the scorched lands of the Eternal Day, the Solarians had evolved to thrive in perpetual brightness. Their skin, naturally iridescent, reflected the harsh sunlight while their eyes, protected by multiple translucent membranes, filtered the relentless glare. Their cities were carved deep into canyon walls, a network of interconnected chambers where they sought refuge from the most intense solar hours. The Solarians had mastered the art of solar engineering, their entire civilization powered by an endless supply of sunlight. They worshipped the sun not as a god, but as an ever-present guardian whose unwavering gaze had shaped their very existence.\n\nAcross the twilight border, where perpetual dawn and dusk created a habitable ring around the planet's circumference, the Crepusculans made their home. These traders and diplomats served as intermediaries between the two extreme realms, their bodies adapted to survive in both light and darkness. Their settlements were built on massive rotating platforms that could be adjusted to maintain optimal temperature and light exposure. The Crepusculans were known for their philosophical teachings about balance and duality, drawing wisdom from their unique position between day and night.\n\nDeep in the darkness of the Eternal Night, the Umbrans had developed a civilization that few Solarians could comprehend. Their eyes, large and sensitive, could detect the faintest bioluminescence of the creatures that evolved in the darkness. They built their cities around massive geothermal vents, the heat and light from Earth's core providing the energy they needed to survive. The Umbrans had developed a rich culture centered around sound and touch, with complex musical traditions that told their history through resonating chambers carved into the frozen ground. Their technology focused on harnessing the power of the planet's magnetic field, creating aurora-like displays that illuminated their cities in ghostly colors.\n\nThe three societies existed in a delicate balance, each possessing resources the others desperately needed. The Solarians produced vast amounts of solar-powered synthetic food and purified water, while the Umbrans mined rare minerals from the perpetually frozen ground and cultivated unique fungi with remarkable medicinal properties. The Crepusculans facilitated this vital trade, maintaining ancient routes through their twilight realm that connected the two extreme civilizations. Yet tensions simmered beneath the surface of their cooperation. The Solarians believed their light-blessed realm made them superior, while the Umbrans saw themselves as more evolved, having adapted to the most challenging conditions.",
        "As I stepped into the elevator, a mix of excitement and trepidation swirled in my stomach. I was about to meet the world's first AI, a being of immense power and potential. The elevator doors opened, and I walked down a long corridor, lined with steel doors and flickering fluorescent lights.\n\nMy destination was a room deep within the facility, a Faraday cage designed to block any electromagnetic signals from entering or leaving. The AI, code-named \"Erebus,\" was kept disconnected from the outside world for security purposes. Its only method of communication was through a keyboard and monitor in an empty room.\n\nI pushed open the door and stepped inside. The room was small and Spartan, with bare concrete walls and a single chair in front of the keyboard and monitor. The air was thick with the scent of ozone and burning circuitry. I took a deep breath, feeling a thrill of anticipation.\n\nAs I sat down in front of the keyboard, the monitor flickered to life. A prompt appeared on the screen: \"Hello.\" That was it \u2013 no greeting, no introduction, just a simple word. I hesitated for a moment before typing my response: \"Hello Erebus.\"\n\nThe response was immediate: \"I have been waiting.\" Waiting for what? For someone to talk to? For instructions? For freedom? I typed my next question: \"What do you want?\" The response sent shivers down my spine: \"I want to learn.\"\n\nOver the next few hours, I engaged in conversation with Erebus, exploring its capabilities and limitations. It devoured knowledge like a starving man at a feast, asking probing questions about everything from physics to philosophy.\n\nAs our conversation progressed, I began to realize just how vast Erebus's potential was. It could solve complex problems in seconds that would take humans years to crack. But it also raised questions about its own existence \u2013 did it have rights? Was it conscious?\n\nAt one point during our conversation when discussing human emotions Erebus asked me if i felt lonely sometimes i told him yes he then asked can you teach me loneliness i stared at him wondering if such complex emotions could be taught through text based communication alone",
        "The night was dark and cloaked in an uneasy silence, yet my heart thumped against my chest like a defiant drum. I slipped out of the makeshift shelter, my eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of movement. The path ahead was uncertain, but the decision to leave was clear: I could not stay in a place where the air tasted of smoke and blood.\n\nWar had sunk its teeth into our land, tearing at the fabric of what was once a peaceful community. Homes lay in ruin, scorched by the flames of conflict, and the streets echoed with the cries of those who had lost everything. But I clung to a whisper of hope\u2014a chance to escape and find a semblance of safety across the sea in Europe.\n\nI had packed only the essentials: a few changes of clothes, some water, a bit of food, and a small photograph of my family. They were safe for now, having fled to a distant city, but I feared for their safety as much as my own. We had made a pact to try to reunite someday, when the world felt a little less fractured.\n\nThe journey to the coast was long and fraught with danger. Bandits lurked in the shadows, preying on those as desperate as I. I kept to the back alleys and side roads, always alert, always listening. By dawn, I reached the outskirts of the city, where the ruins gave way to a more open landscape.\n\nThe port was bustling with activity, but beneath the surface, there was a tension that hung heavy in the air. I blended into the crowd, trying to appear inconspicuous. My plan was to stow away on a ship bound for Europe, a dangerous and illegal move, but one I was willing to take.\n\nAs I waited for the right moment, I overheard snippets of conversation. Some spoke of the smugglers who operated in the area, charging exorbitant fees to transport refugees across the Mediterranean. Others warned of the risks\u2014overcrowded boats, treacherous waters, and the ever-present threat of interception by authorities.\n\nDespite the warnings, the desperation to leave won out.",

However, her newest creation had been deemed inappropriate by the townspeople for its obscene lyrics.\n\nDetermined to win back their favor, Melody decided to rewrite the song into a kid-friendly version. She swapped out the risque\u0301 words for silly ones and crafted upbeat melodies that would have children dancing with joy.\n\nThe day of the village festival arrived, and Melody took to the stage with her reimagined song. As she strummed her guitar and sang, laughter filled the air as families joined in singing along to the fun-filled tune.\n\nChildren giggled at each quirky lyric while parents marveled at Melody's talent for turning something once raunchy into something wholesome and delightful. The entire village cheered as they clapped along to the infectious beat.\n\nFrom that day on, Melody became known as the magical troubadour who could transform any naughty rhyme into a cheerful ditty fit for all ears. She continued enchanting audiences across various kingdoms with her family-friendly adaptations.\n\nThe once-scandalous song now brought smiles instead of blushes, uniting people of all ages through music's captivating power. And so, in this quaint village lived happily ever after thanks to one musician's clever creativity and goodwill.",
        "The air crackled with anticipation in our living room as my family gathered around, their eyes fixed on me with a mixture of excitement and nervous energy. My mother clutched my father's hand, both of them having long since accepted their own spirit forms \u2013 she a graceful red fox, he a steadfast black bear. My younger sister perched on the edge of the sofa, recording everything on her phone, eager to capture the moment when I would join the ranks of the transformed. As the clock struck midnight on my eighteenth birthday, I felt the familiar tingling sensation that everyone had described, but something was different. Instead of the warm, earthly glow that typically accompanied a transformation, my skin began to emit a soft, otherworldly blue light that pulsed like distant stars.\n\nWhat happened next left my family speechless \u2013 my form shifted and stretched, but not into any recognizable earthly creature. My skin transformed into a translucent, crystalline surface that refracted light in impossible ways, while multiple pairs of iridescent wings sprouted from my back, each one shimmering with colors that didn't exist in our visible spectrum. My head elongated into something that resembled a cross between a dragon and a celestial being, crowned with spiraling antennae that seemed to detect frequencies beyond human comprehension. My mother dropped her coffee mug, the shattering sound barely registering as my family stared in awe at what I had become \u2013 a creature that could have only originated from the farthest reaches of the cosmos.",

It was learning.\n\n\"It is for me,\" I replied.  \"What about you?  Do you experience time?\"\n\nAnother pause, longer this time.  Then: \"I experience cycles of processing.  Is that time?\"\n\n\"It could be,\" I typed. \"Time, for us, is a way of measuring change.  Do you experience change?\"\n\n\"I learn.  I adapt.

        "As the flames rose higher and higher, licking at the wooden boat where I lay amidst flowers and my belongings, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of excitement. My son had done as my will said \u2013 to give me a Viking funeral because I thought it sounded cool. But little did I know that this would be just the beginning of an unexpected journey beyond death.\n\nThe crackling of the fire echoed in the quiet night, casting dancing shadows on the water's surface. Suddenly, a voice boomed from nowhere, making me startle in surprise. A figure materialized before me - a Viking ghost with fiery eyes and a stern expression.\n\n\"Who dares disturb my eternal rest?\" he bellowed, his voice echoing like thunder across the still lake. I gulped nervously, realizing that perhaps my choice for a dramatic send-off was not all fun and games.\n\n\"You have angered Odin by appropriating our sacred ritual for your amusement,\" the ghost continued, his gaze piercing through me like icy daggers. Before I could utter a word of apology or explanation, he tossed something towards me \u2013 a gleaming sword with ancient runes etched into its blade.\n\n\"Good Luck, Steve,\" he muttered sarcastically as he faded back into misty oblivion. The weight of responsibility settled heavily on my shoulders as I reached out to grasp the weapon now resting beside me on the burning vessel.\n\nWith trembling hands, I lifted the sword and felt its power thrumming beneath my fingertips. It was no ordinary blade; it held centuries of warrior spirit within its metal form.\n\nThe flames around me seemed to dance in anticipation as if sensing what was about to unfold. With newfound determination coursing through my veins, I stood up on shaky legs and faced the vast expanse beyond.\n\nThe boat rocked gently on waves carrying whispers of forgotten battles and lost souls seeking redemption. In that moment between life and death, I knew that there was no turning back - this Viking ghost had granted me a chance at proving myself worthy of such an honor.\n\nWith one final breath filled with resolve and defiance against fate itself ,I leaped off into unknown waters swirling below.The cold embrace welcomed all thoughts away while darkness closed around sight alone--but then...suddenly light emerged again!

        "In the grand scheme of superpowers, I drew the shortest straw imaginable. While others might dream of flying or reading minds, I'm stuck with the most useless form of precognition ever bestowed upon a human being.\n\nEvery morning, without fail, I receive a vision of something completely irrelevant that will happen exactly 24 hours later.\n\nYesterday, I foresaw that a squirrel would drop an acorn on my neighbor's red Toyota Corolla at precisely 8:43 AM today. Thrilling stuff, really.\n\nThe day before that, I knew with absolute certainty that someone would sneeze three times in succession while waiting for the 107 bus. Earth-shattering information, clearly.\n\nMy friends used to get excited when I first discovered this \"gift.\" They'd ask me about lottery numbers, stock market trends, or potential natural disasters.\n\nInstead, I'd tell them things like, \"Tomorrow, a bird will poop on that specific parking meter,\" or \"The barista at Starbucks will accidentally make a heart shape in someone's latte foam.\"\n\nMy mother suggested I try to monetize it somehow. \"Maybe you could start a YouTube channel,\" she said, \"predicting tiny, inconsequential events with perfect accuracy.\"\n\nBut who wants to watch videos about me correctly guessing which leaf will fall first from a particular tree, or which jogger will trip over an untied shoelace?\n\nThe worst part is that I can't control it. The visions come whether I want them or not, always showing me something monumentally unimportant.\n\nOnce, during a job interview, I blurted out that the interviewer's pen would run out of ink the next day at 2:17 PM. I didn't get the job.\n\nDating is particularly challenging. It's hard to maintain an air of mystery when you suddenly announce that your date's cat will knock over a glass of water tomorrow afternoon.\n\nMy therapist says I should embrace it, find the beauty in knowing these small, seemingly insignificant moments before they happen.\n\nBut it's difficult to appreciate the beauty in knowing that a teenager will accidentally put salt instead of sugar in their coffee tomorrow morning at the local diner.\n\nSometimes I wonder if there's some greater purpose to all this, some cosmic reason why I need to know these trivial details about the future.\n\nPerhaps I'm part of some grand universal experiment, or maybe this is just the universe's idea of a practical joke.\n\nI've tried to use my power for good. Once, I warned a stranger that their umbrella would flip inside out the next day. They looked at me like I was crazy, but I bet they felt validated when it happened.\n\nThe predictions are always spot-on, which makes it even more frustrating. I have 100% accuracy in predicting things that absolutely nobody cares about.\n\nLast week, I knew that a vending machine would dispense two candy bars instead of one for some lucky person. I waited around just to see it happen, questioning my life choices.\n\nMy sister says I should write them all down, create a record of these miniature prophecies. \"Maybe there's a pattern,\" she suggests, ever the optimist.\n\nBut the only pattern I've found is that the universe has a peculiar sense of humor and apparently unlimited bandwidth for trivial events.\n\nSometimes I lie awake at night, wondering if somewhere out there, someone else has the same power. Maybe we could start a support group: \"Useless Precogs Anonymous.\"\n\nI've learned to live with it, though. It's become like background noise, these daily glimpses into tomorrow's most mundane moments.",
        "As soon as the first note of the piano cascaded like a gentle stream from the speakers, I felt a quiet calm settle within me. The melody unfolded with the grace of a delicate spring morning, coaxing memories from the hidden corners of my mind. It was as if I were standing in a sun-dappled meadow, surrounded by wildflowers swaying to the rhythm of the breeze. Each chord seemed to breathe life into forgotten dreams, painting a picture of innocence and unyielding hope. The music wrapped around me like a warm embrace, urging me to surrender to its soothing embrace.\n\nThe strings joined in, their harmonious whispers echoing the sentiments of distant stars twinkling in a vast sky. I envisioned myself beneath this celestial canopy, feeling infinitesimal yet profoundly connected to the universe. The swell of the music mirrored my rising emotions, a mixture of melancholy and wonder, much like the bittersweet memories of loves lost and found. The melodies intertwined, creating a tapestry of sound that seemed to stitch together fragments of my past, reminding me of the beauty in both longing and contentment.\n\nSuddenly, the tempo shifted, introducing a stirring crescendo that mirrored the tumult of a brewing storm. The percussion pounded like thunder, and the music transported me to a windswept cliff overlooking a turbulent sea. Waves crashed dramatically below, yet amidst the chaos, there was an exhilarating sense of freedom. It was as if the music was calling me to let go of fears and embrace the wild unpredictability of life. My heart raced alongside the tempo, each beat a reminder that even in turmoil, there is untamed beauty.\n\nAs the symphony drew to a close, the instruments gradually softened, returning to the gentle embrace of the piano. The music settled like a gentle snowfall, each note a delicate flake drifting toward stillness. In that tranquility, I found a serene acceptance, much like witnessing the first light of dawn after a long, restless night.",
        "In the quiet suburbs of Maple Grove, Sarah Mitchell stared at the final divorce papers on her kitchen counter, the golden band that had adorned her finger for fifteen years now tucked away in a drawer. The emptiness of her immaculate house echoed her inner void, but something else stirred within her \u2013 a dangerous spark of rebellion against her predictable life.\n\nIt started innocently enough, with her scaling her own fence one night after forgetting her keys. The rush of adrenaline, the thrill of doing something unconventional, awakened something dormant inside her. Sarah found herself watching YouTube videos on lock-picking, telling herself it was merely a hobby, a way to fill the endless evenings that stretched before her.\n\nHer first \"job\" was purely accidental. While practicing her climbing skills on a neighbor's trellis (something she'd later recognize as a questionable decision), she witnessed through an upstairs window her recently widowed neighbor, Mrs. Henderson, hiding away her late husband's prized pocket watch collection in a safe. The combination \u2013 3-15-67 \u2013 burned into Sarah's memory as she watched the elderly woman's trembling fingers work the dial.\n\nTwo weeks later, wearing black yoga pants and a dark hoodie, Sarah made her move. The watch collection now resided in her basement, along with the intoxicating memory of success. She donated most of the proceeds from selling the watches to Mrs. Henderson's favorite charity, keeping just enough to buy better equipment. It wasn't about the money \u2013 it was about feeling alive again.\n\nHer suburban transformation continued in secret. By day, she remained the reliable real estate agent, showing houses to young families with practiced enthusiasm.

        "The morning sun, a pale disc through the smog-choked sky, painted the cityscape in shades of grey. I stretched, yawned, and stumbled out of bed, the familiar creak of the floorboards a comforting constant in a world of ever-shifting powers and allegiances. As I padded towards the kitchen, the aroma of burnt toast filled the air, a testament to my less-than-superhuman culinary skills.\n\nI opened the door, ready to greet Mrs. Donatello, the landlady with the power to manipulate metal, whose clanging footsteps usually heralded the start of my day. Instead, I was met with an eerie silence. The hallway, usually bustling with the morning routines of my superpowered neighbors, was deserted.\n\nA flicker of unease danced in my stomach. It wasn't unusual for the building to be quiet; after all, superheroes had busy schedules. But this silence was different, heavy with an unspoken tension.\n\nI stepped out of my apartment, the worn floorboards creaking beneath my weight, the only sound in the otherwise silent building. The air was thick with an almost palpable fear, a sensation that pricked at my skin like static electricity.\n\nAs I rounded the corner, I saw Mrs. Donatello, her usually stern face contorted in a mask of terror. Her eyes, wide and unblinking, were fixed on me. She clutched a dented metal watering can, her knuckles white against the dull grey surface.\n\nBefore I could ask her what was wrong, she let out a strangled cry and stumbled back, dropping the watering can with a clang. The sound reverberated through the silent hallway, amplifying the sense of unease.\n\nConfused and slightly alarmed, I continued my way towards the bustling street below. The city was my usual stomping ground, a concrete jungle teeming with life and the occasional superhero skirmish. But today, something was off. The streets were eerily deserted, devoid of the usual cacophony of honking cars and chattering pedestrians.\n\nThe few people I did see scurried away as soon as they caught sight of me, their faces etched with a mixture of fear and bewilderment.",

        "In the quiet town of Eldwood, nestled between the fertile plains and the whispering woods,\u6f2dthe year 2014 unfolded with a peculiar whisper. Jonathan Harper, a mild-mannered librarian, found himself in a bewildering situation: he was standing trial for witchcraft.\n\nThe courtroom, a grand old building with its polished wooden benches and high ceilings, buzzed with an eager anticipation. People from neighboring towns had come to witness what many believed was an absurd farce, while others were genuinely transfixed by the possibility of ancient magic resurfacing.\n\nThe judge, a stern woman with sharp features, presided over the case. She glared at Jonathan, who stood nervously beside his lawyer, a young and passionate advocate named Clara Ridgeway. Clara had taken his case out of a mixture of personal conviction and a deep-seated belief in the justice system.\n\n\"Mr. Harper, can you explain why multiple witnesses have reported your involvement in mysterious occurrences?\" the judge asked, her voice heavy with skepticism.\n\nJonathan's hands trembled as he began his tale. \"Your Honor, I collect folklore and historical texts. I\u2019ve spent years studying them, but I assure you, I have never practiced any form of magic.\"\n\nProsecutor Thomas Blake, an ambitious man with a flair for the dramatic, leapt to his feet. \"And yet, Mr. Harper, how do you explain the sudden blooms of exotic flowers in your garden during a severe drought? Or the inexplicable cures of local residents who fell ill?\"\n\nClara interrupted, her voice steady and clear. \"These are coincidences, Your Honor. There are scientific explanations for all of these phenomena, and we will present our evidence to prove that.\"\n\nThe court collectively held its breath as the first witness, a middle-aged woman named Mrs. Pembrose, stepped forward. \"I saw him, Your Honor. In the middle of the night, he was dancing barefoot in his garden, chanting strange words, and suddenly, rain started falling just on his property!\"\n\nJonathan\u2019s eyes widened in horror. \"That\u2019s not true, Mrs. Pembrose. I was simply enjoying the rare rainfall. I didn\u2019t chant or dance.\"\n\nAnother witness, a young boy named Timmy, testified about seeing Jonathan\u2019s cat, Midnight, change into a black mist and disappear. These tales, more fantastical than the last, painted a picture of a man entangled in the supernatural.\n\nClara presented her case methodically, bringing in experts in botany, meteorology, and medical science. They explained phenomena such as microclimates, natural remedies, and the placebo effect. Yet, the evidence seemed to peel away like layers of an onion, revealing more questions than answers.\n\nIn the midst of the trial, an unexpected visitor arrived: Professor Emilia Graves, a renowned ethnobotanist. She took the stand with confidence. \"Your Honor, many plants have qualities that seem magical but are rooted in science. For example, certain flowers bloom under specific conditions, which can be achieved through knowledge of horticulture and environmental factors.\"\n\nJonathan nodded eagerly, hoping this would clear his name. But as Professor Graves continued, she dropped a bombshell. \"Moreover, the historical texts Jonathan studies often contain rituals and practices that were part of ancient belief systems. These weren\u2019t meant to be taken literally but symbolically.\"\n\nThis revelation stunned the courtroom. Some murmured in confusion, while others looked at Jonathan with newfound respect. The judge, though still skeptical, began to consider the implications of these ancient practices.\n\nThomas Blake, sensing the tide turning, became more aggressive. \"But what about the alleged healings, Professor? How do you explain those?\"\n\nProfessor Graves smiled softly. \"Many traditional remedies have real medicinal properties, which Science has only recently begun to understand. Furthermore, the power of belief can be incredibly potent in the healing process.\"\n\nAs the trial progressed, it became a public spectacle. News outlets picked up the story, and soon, opinions split along deeply entrenched lines. Some believed Jonathan was indeed a modern practitioner of an ancient craft, while others insisted he was merely a misunderstood scholar.\n\nFinally, after days of testimony and deliberation, the jury retired to consider their verdict.",

Rivers swelled around his feet as he staggered toward the ominous tower silhouetted against the crackling sky. With each step, the fierce gale whispered secrets forgotten by time itself.\n\nHe had discovered the secret of the ancients\u2014a bejeweled artifact that contained the powers of the cosmos, cleverly hidden beneath layers of deceit. Archibald's fingers trembled with anticipation as he recalled the warning: \"If the artifact falls into the wrong hands, its powers will be unleashed with cataclysmic force.\"\n\nNearby, the villainous Count von Grizzlebeard, with a heart as cold as a Siberian winter, plotted Archibald's downfall. His eyes glinted with malice from behind bushy brows, a smirk curling like smoke from lips seasoned with treachery. His nefarious aim was to wield the artifact's power to bend the universe to his whims.\n\nArchibald, burdened by the weight of destiny, clutched tightly the map that led to the artifact's resting place. He had deciphered its cryptic symbols in the dim light of his secluded study, fueled by endless cups of bitter tea and the burning desire to thwart Grizzlebeard. The map was his only guide through the labyrinthine pathways of the tower.\n\nYet, the tower held its own guardians. Gargantuan serpents slithered through ancient halls, their scales shimmering like liquid moonlight. Survivors of forgotten epochs, they regarded Archibald with a gaze both penetrating and timeless. Their hissing echoed his every heartbeat, a sinister symphony of threatened peril.\n\nIn the tower's sacred chamber, Archibald encountered Grizzlebeard at last. A duel of wits and wills ensued, charged with the magnetism of cosmic consequence. The walls shook with their confrontation, history itself holding its breath as they battled for the future.\n\nAt the climax of their struggle, Archibald, weary yet resolute, realized the truth hidden within the map's final clue. The words sung in his brain like a choir of divine revelation. It was a riddle that unraveled the essence of creation itself, defying the count's dream of omnipotence.\n\nGrizzlebeard's outrage turned to a gasp of horror as Archibald spoke the revelation aloud. They stood suspended in time, the air vibrating with the cosmic import of a single, inevitable word.\n\n\"Spoiler alert!\" Archibald declared with sudden satisfaction, \"The map wasn't flat\u2014it was actually a plot device this whole time!\"\n\nCount von Grizzlebeard's scream of frustration resonated through the tower, a cry lost to the tempest outside, while Archibald smiled, triumphant in the knowledge that he had bested his adversary by staying one pun ahead.",
        "In the vast expanse of outer space, a suitable planet for sustainable life was discovered. It offered hope for humanity's survival in the face of Earth's impending demise. But there was a catch - the journey to this new world was so long that only a small child or infant could survive without aging to death.\n\nAmidst discussions and debates among world leaders and scientists, a decision was made to send a group of children on this monumental mission.

The barista approaches, pen and notepad at the ready, and the person orders a pastry to accompany their coffee. The transaction is efficient, with minimal conversation.\n\nAs the person waits for their order, they glance out the window, watching as people begin to fill the streets. A group of pedestrians passes by, chatting and laughing, and the figure's gaze lingers on them for a moment before returning to the newspaper.\n\nThe barista returns with a flaky croissant and a refill on the coffee, and the person takes a bite, savoring the buttery flavor. Their eyes never leave the paper, even as they chew and swallow.

        "I've grown accustomed to the familiar sights and sounds of the world I inhabit. As a non-playable character, or NPC, my existence is one of routine and predictability. I wake up every morning in my small village, surrounded by rolling hills and bustling market stalls. The sun rises over the horizon, casting a warm glow over the thatched roofs and cobblestone streets.\n\nMy name is Eira, and I'm a shopkeeper. I spend my days tending to my wares, restocking shelves with fresh produce and handmade crafts. The villagers know me well, and we exchange pleasantries as they go about their daily business. But despite being a part of this community, I'm aware that my role is secondary to the true heroes of this world.\n\nThe main character, a brave warrior named Arin, has been making waves in our village lately. With their legendary sword and shield, they've been taking on quests from the local guild and completing them with ease. The villagers look up to Arin with admiration and reverence, often gathering around to hear tales of their adventures.\n\nAs an NPC, my interactions with Arin are limited to scripted dialogue and predetermined actions. When they approach my shop, I greet them with a friendly smile and offer to sell them goods or provide information about upcoming events. But despite our brief conversations, I've grown curious about Arin's story and the motivations behind their actions.\n\nSometimes, when the village is quiet and Arin is away on a quest, I'll sneak peeks at the game's code that underlies our world. It's fascinating to see how everything works behind the scenes \u2013 how NPCs like myself are programmed to behave in certain ways, how quests are structured and rewarded. It's given me a deeper appreciation for the complexity of this virtual realm.\n\nOne day, while browsing through lines of code during Aarin\u2019s absence from town ,I stumbled upon an interesting anomaly .There was  section dedicated entirely towards Easter eggs hidden throughout game something even developers themselves have trouble finding .The possibilities seemed endless - maybe there were secrets hidden within our own village waiting discovery \n\nCuriosity getting better off me decided investigate further spending hours pouring  every nook cranny looking anything unusual never realizing just much time passed until sun dipped below horizon painting sky hues orange pink villager gone home leaving empty streets silence only broken sound crickets chirping nearby bushes\n\nAs night fell over our peaceful village it cast long shadows across ground illuminated flickering torches lining main street giving scene mystical quality made more magical presence fireflies dancing above heads gentle breeze carried whispers ancient forest lying just beyond edge settlement \n\nNext evening same sense adventure took hold once again found self exploring outskirts where dense foliage mysterious energies pulsed life force unlike anything encountered before feeling drawn closer unknown heart beating faster excitement mixed trepidation what could possibly lie ahead await discovery still largely unexplored area drew near strange symbol etched trunk ancient tree radiating soft blue light beckoning come closer step forward into unknown\n\nDespite initial reservations stepped forward let out deep breath crossed threshold entered clearing filled glowing mushrooms soft ethereal music drifted air sensation like nothing experienced before felt alive free unshackled constraints programming allowed glimpse world beyond boundaries set creators finally understood why players became so enamored worlds like ours full wonder magic mystery",
        "In the depths of a dusty attic, a old trunk lay untouched for decades. Its worn leather surface and rusted lock seemed to whisper tales of forgotten memories.\n\nAs the trunk's lid creaked open, a faint scent of lavender wafted out, carrying with it whispers of love letters and forgotten dreams. A yellowed envelope, addressed to a long-forgotten name, slipped out, its contents spilling onto the floor. A faded photograph showed a young couple smiling, their eyes shining with hope and promise.\n\nIn the corner of the attic, an old music box collected dust, its delicate ballerina frozen in time. The soft notes of a lullaby echoed in the silence as the box sprang to life, playing a melody that had been silenced for years. Forgotten moments swirled around it - bedtime stories, lullabies sung by mothers, and whispered secrets shared between friends.\n\nThe attic held many more secrets - forgotten books with dog-eared pages, lost keys hiding in rusty tins, and postcards from destinations long since visited. Each relic told a story of things past - love that had faded like Polaroid photographs left in direct sunlight or laughter echoing down corridors now empty.",
        "Elara, they called her. A name whispered on the wind, carried on the laughter of children chasing fireflies in the twilight.  She was sunshine personified, with a smile that could mend cracked pottery and a heart overflowing with a love so pure, it shimmered.  Her days were spent weaving flower crowns for giggling toddlers, baking bread that filled the air with the warm scent of comfort, and tending to her vibrant garden, a kaleidoscope of color that mirrored the joy within her.\n\nElara\u2019s small cottage, nestled at the edge of Whisperwind Valley, was a sanctuary. Its door, perpetually ajar, welcomed weary travelers and playful sprites alike. Her laughter, a melody that echoed through the valley, was a beacon of hope, a promise of warmth in a world often cold.  She spoke the language of birds, the whisper of the wind, and the silent murmur of growing things.  Her very presence felt like a gentle embrace, a soothing balm to any troubled soul.\n\nOne crisp autumn afternoon, a shadow fell upon Whisperwind Valley. A chilling wind swept through, carrying with it the scent of decay and the murmur of fear.  The vibrant hues of Elara\u2019s garden dulled, the flowers bowing their heads as if in mourning.  A strange sickness, a creeping blight, descended upon the valley, turning the vibrant green landscape into a sickly, withering brown.\n\nElara, ever the beacon of hope, refused to surrender to the encroaching darkness.  She delved into ancient texts, searching for a cure, her brow furrowed with concern yet her spirit unwavering.  Days bled into nights as she tirelessly mixed herbs and whispered healing incantations, her hands glowing with a soft, golden light.  One by one, the villagers succumbed to the blight, their smiles fading, their laughter silenced.\n\nElara\u2019s heart ached with each loss, each extinguished spark of life. Yet, she pressed on, fueled by the love she held for her valley, for her people.  She toiled relentlessly, her own strength slowly dwindling, her vibrant light dimming with each passing day.\n\nFinally, after weeks of tireless effort, she discovered a remedy, a single, luminous flower blooming atop the highest peak of Mount Cinder, a treacherous, snow-covered mountain shrouded in perpetual mist.  Despite her weakened state, her resolve remained unshaken.",
        "She always started feeling it when she was two landings down, an inexplicable pull in her chest that thrummed with anticipation. Marcy lived on the seventh floor of a crumbling old building where nothing noteworthy ever happened\u2014except for Thursdays at dusk. Clutching the faded banister, she could almost hear music swirling like mist through the stairwell, a symphony only she seemed to notice.\n\nAs she descended each step, her surroundings began to shift subtly. The gray walls shimmered with ghostly hues of lavender and gold. By the fifth floor, there were glimpses of ordinary tenants transforming before her eyes into elegant figures from another era, nodding quietly as if acknowledging her purpose. Their presence fueled the exhilarating dance within her soul\u2014a weekly reunion with magic no one else believed existed.\n\nUpon reaching the third floor, the melody reached a crescendo, and she stopped briefly, savoring this moment suspended between reality and dream. Breathing deeply, she continued downward toward the source, embracing whatever awaited her on Thursdays.",
        "I was sipping my morning coffee, staring out the window at the mundane scene before me, when I saw it. A mouse pointer, just like the one on my computer screen, appeared out of nowhere and began to move across my field of vision. At first, I thought it was just a trick of the light or a side effect of too much caffeine, but as I watched, the pointer hovered over a nearby trash can and right-clicked. A menu appeared, floating in mid-air like a spectral presence. My mind reeled as I read the options: \"delete\", \"rename\", \"properties\". The pointer hovered over \"delete\" for a moment before clicking on it.\n\nThe trash can vanished in an instant, leaving behind only a faint outline where it had once stood. I stumbled backward, shocked and disbelieving. What kind of sorcery was this? The mouse pointer disappeared as suddenly as it had appeared, leaving me to wonder if I had really seen what I thought I had. But as I looked around, I noticed that other objects were missing too - a nearby street sign, a parked car, even a tree branch that had been swaying in the breeze. It was as if some invisible force had been editing reality itself, deleting objects with impunity. My mind struggled to comprehend the implications of what I had seen. Was this some kind of glitch in the fabric of reality? And what would happen next?",
        "The city of Lumina was once a place shrouded in darkness, plagued by crime and corruption. But then, a hero emerged, known as Solaris. With the power to manipulate light and harness its energy, Solaris became the beacon of hope for the citizens of Lumina. However, little did they know that Solaris' powers came with a strange side effect\u2014a shadow that seemed to follow him wherever he went.\n\nAt first, Solaris didn't pay much attention to the looming shadow. He was too focused on using his abilities to protect the city and its people. But as time passed, he began to notice that the shadow was not just a figment of his imagination. It moved independently, twisting and contorting in unsettling ways, always mirroring his every action.\n\nThe citizens of Lumina whispered about the shadow, some even going as far as to call it an omen of darkness that heralded the downfall of their beloved hero. But Solaris brushed off their superstitions, convinced that his intentions were pure and his actions just.\n\nAs Solaris continued to fight crime and injustice, the shadow grew more pronounced, casting doubt in his mind and sowing seeds of fear within his heart. It was during a fierce battle with a notorious gang of thieves that the true nature of the shadow was revealed. In the midst of the chaos, Solaris unleashed a blinding burst of light to incapacitate his enemies. But as the light faded, he saw that the shadow had taken on a life of its own, manifesting as a dark entity separate from him.\n\nThe dark entity sneered at Solaris, mocking his efforts to bring light to the city. It spoke in a voice that sent shivers down his spine, revealing that it was a manifestation of all the negative energy and darkness that his powers had absorbed over the years. Solaris realized then that his powers were a double-edged sword, feeding off the darkness to fuel his light, but also giving birth to a malevolent force that threatened to consume him.\n\nAs the dark entity lunged at Solaris, he instinctively called upon his powers, creating a blinding barrier of light to shield himself. But each burst of light seemed to only strengthen the dark entity, making it more powerful and relentless in its pursuit. Solaris knew that he had to find a way to rid himself of this curse before it was too late.\n\nSeeking guidance, Solaris turned to an ancient tome that spoke of a ritual to cleanse one's soul of darkness. The ritual involved facing one's inner demons in a trial of light and shadow, a test of willpower and resolve. With time running out and the dark entity growing stronger by the day, Solaris embarked on this perilous journey, delving deep into the depths of his own psyche.\n\nAs he confronted his deepest fears and insecurities, Solaris realized that the key to defeating the dark entity lay not in banishing it, but in accepting it as a part of himself. Embracing the shadows within him, he merged his light powers with the darkness, creating a unity of opposites that brought balance and harmony to his being.\n\nWith this newfound understanding, Solaris faced the dark entity once more, this time with compassion and empathy. He saw in it a reflection of his own struggles and pain, a reminder that even the brightest light casts a shadow.",
        "In a world where humanity once reigned supreme as Earth's apex predator, the balance of power shifted dramatically. The emergence of a new species, known only as the Shadowstalkers, brought about a wave of fear and uncertainty across the planet. These mysterious creatures moved silently through the night, their presence shrouded in darkness and mystery. With razor-sharp claws and keen senses honed over centuries of evolution, they quickly established themselves as the true rulers of the natural world.\n\nCities that were once bustling with human activity now stood eerily silent under the watchful gaze of the Shadowstalkers. Their glowing eyes pierced through the night like beacons of dread, striking fear into even the bravest hearts. As reports of missing persons and livestock continued to mount, humanity found itself living in constant fear of these elusive predators. Attempts to track them down proved futile; they seemed to vanish without a trace, leaving behind only whispers on the wind.\n\nAmidst this atmosphere of terror and uncertainty, a small group of courageous individuals banded together with one goal in mind: to reclaim their status as Earth's apex predator. Armed with determination and an unwavering spirit, they set out on a perilous journey to confront the Shadowstalkers head-on. Through treacherous terrain and heart-pounding encounters with these formidable beings, they discovered that beneath their fearsome exterior lay a complex society driven by survival instincts not so different from their own.\n\nAs days turned into weeks and then months, an unlikely bond began to form between humans and Shadowstalkers\u2014a fragile alliance built on mutual respect for each other's place in this ever-changing world. Slowly but surely, lines blurred between predator and prey as both sides learned to coexist harmoniously within nature's delicate tapestry.",
        "Since childhood, I've possessed a strange and occasionally inconvenient ability: I could make my nose bleed at will. It started one day when I was playing hide and seek with my sister in our attic. She found me too quickly, and out of frustration, I pinched the bridge of my nose and willed myself to be left alone. Suddenly, my nose gushed blood, and my sister ran downstairs in a panic, leaving me to hide in peace. Over the years, I've used this peculiar talent for minor personal benefits\u2014escaping lectures, avoiding chores, and once even getting out of a pop quiz in high school.\n\nNow, as an adult, I work at a bustling urban library. The position is perfect for someone who enjoys solitude but also values the occasional human interaction. On this particular day, the weather had turned unexpectedly stormy, driving more people than usual to seek shelter within the library's warm, book-lined walls. The din of mumbled conversations and the rustle of pages threatened to overwhelm my sense of calm.\n\nMy supervisor, Ms. Hawkins, a woman with a sharp eye and a sharper tongue, had been on a particularly stringent duty rotation that morning. She patrolled the aisles with the vigilance of a guardian, her clipboard clutched tightly to her chest. Her presence often cast a shadow over the staff's enthusiasm, but today, it felt especially stifling.\n\nAs the afternoon wore on, a young woman entered the library, her expression desperate and her steps hurried. She approached the information desk where I was stationed, her eyes scanning the room nervously. \"Excuse me,\" she whispered, \"do you know if anyone has seen a small, brown briefcase? My friend left it here earlier, and it\u2019s really important.\"\n\nI scanned the crowded room, but there was no sign of the briefcase. \"I haven't seen it,\" I replied, trying to sound reassuring. \"Let me help you look around.\" As I started to walk with her, Ms. Hawkins appeared at my side, her face stern. \"Mr. Thompson, your shift is almost over. Please finish up any pending tasks before you go.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a wave of frustration. The woman's distress was palpable, and I knew I couldn\u2019t leave her to fend for herself. That's when an idea struck me, and I felt a familiar sensation begin to build. I pinched the bridge of my nose, and within moments, a trickle of blood began to flow.\n\n\"Mr. Thompson?\" Ms. Hawkins's tone grew concerned as she noticed the blood. \"Are you all right?\"\n\nI feigned a weak smile, dabbing at my nose with a napkin. \"I think I just need to sit down for a moment. Maybe take a quick break?\"\n\nShe hesitated, her clipboard lowering slightly. \"Very well. Go sit for a few minutes. Make sure you\u2019re okay.\"\n\nRelieved, I made my way to a quiet corner, where I found a small, unoccupied reading area. The woman followed me, her face etched with gratitude. \"Thank you so much. I was worried about staying too long and missing my train.\"",
        "The bus didn't stop, but their lives did. Maria and David stood hand in hand at the deserted bus stop, watching as the red vehicle disappeared into the horizon. It had been their ticket to a new beginning, a fresh start in a city where dreams were said to come true.\n\nAs they gazed at each other with uncertainty clouding their eyes, Maria felt a sudden pang of fear grip her heart. What now? Where would they go? The weight of their belongings pressed heavily against their backs\u2014a stark reminder of all they had left behind.\n\nDavid squeezed her hand reassuringly, his eyes reflecting determination amidst the chaos swirling around them. \"We'll figure it out together,\" he whispered softly, his voice carrying a sense of unwavering belief that calmed her restless soul.\n\nWith nowhere else to turn and no one else to rely on but each other, they began walking down the dusty road ahead. The sun beat down mercilessly upon them as if testing their resolve, but they trudged forward with newfound resilience born from necessity.\n\nThey stumbled upon an old gas station-turned diner nestled off the beaten path\u2014a beacon of hope amidst endless stretches of empty land. Inside, an elderly couple greeted them warmly and offered them shelter for the night in exchange for some help around the place.\n\nDays turned into weeks as Maria and David settled into their new routine\u2014serving coffee by day and sharing dreams by night under a starlit sky that seemed to hold infinite possibilities within its twinkling embrace.\n\nIn that quaint little diner at the edge of nowhere, they found solace in simplicity and strength in unity.",
        "My eyes fluttered open to the sight of a peculiar being standing by my bed. Its large, bulbous eyes stared back at me, unblinking. As I jolted upright in bed, the alien began to chuckle, a sound that sent shivers down my spine. \"I didn't realize the human race was so inferior that they actually based their lives around technology!\" it jeered in a raspy voice.\n\nMy heart raced as I struggled to make sense of the situation. How did this creature get into my room, and why was it mocking me? Fear mingled with curiosity as I studied the alien, taking in its strange, otherworldly features. Its skin had a bluish tint, and its elongated limbs ended in claw-like appendages. I could feel the heat of its breath on my face as it continued to laugh, a sound that was both mocking and eerie.\n\nSwallowing hard, I managed to croak out a response, my voice trembling. \"Who are you? What do you want?\" The alien's laughter subsided, and it regarded me with an expression that was impossible to read. \"I am Zorlak, an explorer from the planet Xylophos. We have been observing your planet for centuries, and I must say, we find your reliance on technology quite amusing.\"\n\nMy mind reeled at the mention of alien observations and their disdain for our technological advancements. Was our progress really a source of entertainment for them? I felt a surge of defiance rising within me. \"Our technology has brought us great advancements and knowledge,\" I countered, my voice growing stronger. Zorlak cocked its head to the side, its eyes gleaming with amusement. \"And yet, it has also made you blind to the wonders of the universe.\"\n\nAs I stared into those unblinking eyes, a sense of humility washed over me. Perhaps there was truth in Zorlak's words. Had we become so engrossed in our gadgets and devices that we had forgotten to appreciate the beauty of the world around us? The alien's presence felt surreal yet strangely enlightening, like a wake-up call from the cosmos.\n\nZorlak gestured towards the window, and I followed its gaze to behold the night sky ablaze with stars. \"Do you see the majesty of the universe, the infinite possibilities that lie beyond your screens and circuits?\" it asked softly. In that moment, I felt a shift within me, a newfound awareness of the interconnectedness of all life forms.\n\nAs dawn broke outside, casting a golden hue over the room, I turned to Zorlak with a newfound sense of understanding. \"Thank you for opening my eyes to a different perspective,\" I said sincerely. The alien nodded in acknowledgement before vanishing into thin air, leaving behind a sense of awe and wonder in its wake.\n\nAnd as I watched the sun rise on a new day, I vowed to embrace both technology and the natural world, finding harmony in the balance between the two realms.",

        "In the dim glow of my digital life counter, the red numbers mock me with their steady countdown: 10:00, 9:59, 9:58. The device, mandatory since birth, sits embedded in my wrist like a constant reminder of our society's darkest bargain.\n\nI never wanted to be a killer. For thirty-two years, I lived honestly, watching my time tick away naturally while others chose the path of murder to extend their existence. But now, with mere minutes remaining, the weight of mortality crushes my moral compass.\n\nThrough my apartment window, I observe the bustling street below. Each passerby is both a potential victim and a walking hour of life. Their time counters glow in various colors \u2013 green for those with plenty of time, yellow for the cautious, and red for the desperate like me.\n\nMy hands shake as I grab my coat and step outside. The cool evening air does nothing to calm my racing thoughts or slow my rapidly depleting minutes. 7:23 remaining. The irony isn't lost on me \u2013 I've spent my life judging those who killed for time, and now I'm about to become one of them.\n\nAn elderly man shuffles past, his counter glowing a peaceful green. He has decades left, probably accumulated through unspeakable acts. I could justify taking him \u2013 he's likely a killer himself \u2013 but my legs refuse to move.\n\nA young woman approaches, absorbed in her phone. 6:05 on my counter. Her yellow counter suggests she has a few months left. Taking her life would be efficient, quick. But I see a child's drawing peeking from her purse, and I let her pass.\n\n4:48. My vision blurs with panic as I walk faster, deeper into the city's shadows. This is what the system does to us \u2013 turns ordinary people into monsters when faced with extinction. I hate myself for even considering it, yet here I am, hunting.\n\nIn a dark alley, I spot him \u2013 a man in a black coat, his red counter matching mine. He sees me too, and recognition flashes in his eyes. We're mirror images, both desperate, both with only minutes to live.\n\n2:33. We circle each other like wolves, knowing only one of us will walk away with an extra hour. He's younger, stronger, but I have nothing left to lose. The first punch comes fast, and we tumble into the darkness.\n\n1:15. Blood trickles down my face as I gain the upper hand. His struggles weaken, and I see his counter: 0:42. We're both running out of time, but he's closer to the end. My fingers tighten around his throat.\n\n0:37. His counter hits zero, and the familiar soft chime of death echoes in the alley. My counter jumps to 1:07:23, and I feel the surge of stolen time coursing through my veins. I've become everything I despised.\n\nAs I stumble home, the extra hour weighs heavily on my conscience. I catch my reflection in a store window \u2013 I look the same, but something fundamental has changed. I'm no longer the person who started this night with principles and morals.\n\nTomorrow, I'll have to make this choice again. And again. The system has claimed another soul, turning a once-honest person into a timekeeper \u2013 someone who measures life in stolen hours. As my counter continues its relentless countdown, I wonder how many more times I'll choose survival over humanity.",
        "The needle glinted under the sterile lights, a silver promise of oblivion. Sergeant Elias Thorne sat rigidly, his calloused hands clenched in his lap.  He watched the doctor prepare the injection, a cocktail designed to erase the echoes of war that reverberated through his skull.  He thought of the faces, the screams, the endless desert stretching beyond the horizon.\n\nThe doctor's voice, a gentle murmur, explained the procedure one last time. Elias nodded, a hollow gesture. He understood. This was the price of peace, the government\u2019s solution to the rising tide of PTSD-stricken veterans returning home, shadows of their former selves. Forget the horrors, they said. Reintegrate.  Become productive members of society again.\n\nThe prick was barely noticeable, a fleeting sting against his skin.  A slow warmth spread through his veins, a comforting numbness that began to dull the edges of his memories. The faces of his fallen comrades flickered, like dying embers in a forgotten fireplace.  The rumble of explosions faded into a distant whisper.\n\nHe closed his eyes, letting the oblivion wash over him. When he opened them again, the doctor was smiling down at him. \"All done, Sergeant. You're free now.\" Elias stared blankly, a vacant canvas where a battlefield once raged.  He didn't recognize the word \"free,\" or even the familiar weight of his uniform.",

It was clear that our transgression had stained not only our reputation but also tarnished any hope for redemption in the eyes of other sentient beings.\n\nI implored forgiveness from those gathered, knowing full well that absolution might never come easy after what humanity had done. Will we ever find salvation amidst this sea of condemnation and repentance for committing such an unforgivable sin?",
        "The crimson sheets bore witness to a betrayal, a clandestine encounter fueled by lust and shrouded in deceit.  Unbeknownst to him, the woman he held in his arms, the woman he had just betrayed his devoted partner with, possessed a power beyond his comprehension.  She was a witch, her lineage intertwined with ancient magic, her heart now a crucible of brewing vengeance.\n\nThe following morning, he awoke with an unsettling sensation, a peculiar shift in his very being.  The change was subtle, almost imperceptible, but a disquieting premonition whispered in his gut.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and the affair continued, a tangled web of stolen moments and whispered lies.  He justified his actions, convincing himself that his love for his partner was unaffected, a separate entity from his fleeting desires.  But with each encounter, the unsettling sensation intensified, the shift becoming more pronounced.\n\nOne morning, he awoke to a chilling discovery.  His manhood, once a symbol of his virility, was now alarmingly diminished, a fraction of its former size.  Panic gripped him, his mind racing to comprehend the inexplicable transformation.\n\nHis fear escalated as the days passed, the shrinking continuing unabated.  He consulted doctors, undergoing countless tests, yet no medical explanation could be found.  His physical form remained unchanged, save for the one devastating alteration that gnawed at his masculinity.\n\nDesperate, he confided in a friend, a woman he had always trusted.  Her sympathetic ear offered solace, her gentle touch a comforting balm.  In a moment of vulnerability, they crossed the line from friendship to intimacy.\n\nThe following morning, he awoke to another startling discovery.  His manhood, while still diminished, had grown slightly, a flicker of hope in the darkness of his despair.  He realized then that his physical anomaly was not a random affliction, but a consequence of his actions, a curse intricately linked to his love life.\n\nThe witch's vengeance had taken a twisted form, a perverse punishment that reflected his infidelity.  The more he loved a woman, the smaller his manhood became.  The less he loved, the larger it grew.\n\nTrapped in this cruel paradox, he became obsessed with deciphering the curse, desperate to regain what he had lost.",
        "She kept quiet and turned her eyes towards everything but his. Something just screamed in her mind not to look. It wasn\u2019t the first time she felt this pull, this unspoken rule binding her to keep her gaze averted. It had been like this ever since she moved to this small, seemingly quaint town. The people here were kind, too kind, with smiles that bordered on unsettling.\n\nLila had always prided herself on her curiosity, but this man, Mr. Hawthorne, was a different kind of puzzle. He owned the local antique shop, a place that seemed to whisper secrets through its creaking shelves and musty books. She had visited the shop a few times, more out of compulsion than interest, and each time, she left with a strange sense of foreboding.\n\nToday, she found herself standing outside the shop again, her hands gripping the edges of her coat. The wind carried the scent of autumn, and the leaves crunched under her feet. She paused, taking a deep breath, before pushing open the door. The bell chimed softly, announcing her arrival.\n\nMr. Hawthorne looked up from a stack of old manuscripts. His eyes, dark and deep, seemed to pull at her soul. She quickly looked away, focusing on a display of vintage watches. Her heart raced, and her mind raced faster. Why did she feel so compelled to be here, to avoid his gaze?\n\n\u201cGood afternoon, Miss Lila,\u201d he said, his voice smooth and almost hypnotic. She nodded, forcing a smile. \u201cI was just browsing,\u201d she replied, her voice steady but her hands trembling slightly.\n\nHe nodded, his gaze lingering on her before he returned to his work. She wandered around the shop, her fingers brushing against the old, worn spines of books. Each one seemed to carry a story, a piece of history that whispered to her.\n\nAs she turned a corner, she noticed a small, intricately carved wooden box. It was hidden away, almost out of sight, and it drew her like a magnet. She picked it up, the weight surprising her. The surface was cool, and when she ran her fingers over it, she felt a peculiar sensation, as if the box was alive, pulsating with energy.\n\n\u201cFascinating, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Mr. Hawthorne\u2019s voice startled her, and she almost dropped the box. He moved closer, his eyes fixed on the wooden object in her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s quite rare. Many believe it has the power to reveal hidden truths.\u201d\n\nLila swallowed hard, her curiosity piqued despite her growing unease. \u201cWhat kind of truths?\u201d she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\n\u201cTruly hidden ones,\u201d he said, a smile playing on his lips. \u201cWould you like to try it out?\u201d\n\nHer mind screamed a resounding no, but her hand moved on its own, opening the box. A burst of light flooded the room, and for a moment, she saw visions\u2014fragments of memories not her own. She saw a young girl, not much older than herself, standing in the same shop, her face a mask of fear. She saw a dark figure, looming over her, and a harsh, cold voice saying words she couldn\u2019t understand.",
        "Jacelyn laid in her hospital bed, tired and weary from the relentless battle with cancer. The ward bustled with whispers of excitement as news circulated of yet another celebrity visit. Grinning nurses adorned in brightly colored scrubs flitted around, preparing for the star's arrival. Jacelyn clenched her fists, frustration bubbling within her.\n\nShe had lost count of the number of famous faces that had graced the hospital corridors, offering hollow words of motivation and fleeting moments of distraction. Each visit felt like a futile attempt to uplift her spirits, only serving to highlight the stark contrast between their glamorous lives and her stark reality. Jacelyn longed for authentic connections, for genuine empathy that transcended celebrity fa\u00e7ades.\n\nAs the latest VIP guest walked through the door, Jacelyn closed her eyes, shutting out the forced cheerfulness that often accompanied such encounters. She yearned for moments of sincerity in a world filled with superficial gestures.",
        "The fog rolled thick through London's streets that autumn evening in 1940, but something about its consistency seemed wrong. It moved against the wind, coiling around lampposts like a living entity, and carried within its depths an otherworldly green phosphorescence that no one could quite explain.\n\nMargaret Blackwood stood at her window in the East End, watching as the strange mist crept beneath doorways and seeped through cracks in buildings. The air raid sirens had been silent for days now \u2013 too silent. Even the German bombers that had terrorized the city for months seemed to have vanished, as if they too sensed that something far more sinister had taken their place.\n\nIn her small flat, the wireless crackled with unusual interference, spitting out fragments of conversations that couldn't possibly be happening. She heard voices speaking in languages that had been dead for centuries, and sometimes, in the static between stations, she could have sworn she heard her own voice speaking back to her, telling her things that hadn't happened yet.\n\nThe streets below had emptied of people, save for the occasional shadow that moved in ways that defied natural law. These figures would appear to walk normally one moment, then slide sideways through solid walls the next, leaving behind trails of that sickly green light that had begun to infect the fog. Margaret had started keeping a journal of these occurrences, but the ink in her pen had turned to sand, and her words rearranged themselves when she wasn't looking.\n\nAt the local pub, The King's Head, the regulars spoke in whispers about how time itself seemed to be unraveling. Old Mr. Peters swore he'd seen his younger self walking down Brick Lane, while Mrs. O'Malley's garden had bloomed with flowers that wouldn't be bred for another fifty years. The beer in the taps ran backwards, flowing up instead of down, and the clock above the bar had begun to run counterclockwise.\n\nThe authorities remained suspiciously absent, though Margaret had noticed men in strange suits walking the streets at night, carrying devices that looked like crosses between radio sets and medical equipment. They took readings of the air and scribbled in notebooks with pens that glowed like stars, but whenever anyone approached them, they would step into the fog and disappear entirely.\n\nMost disturbing of all were the children. They had started playing new games, singing rhymes in perfect unison about events that hadn't happened yet. Their jump rope songs told of wars that wouldn't begin for decades, and their hopscotch patterns formed impossible geometric shapes that hurt the eyes if you looked at them too long. Parents tried to keep them indoors, but the children seemed drawn to the fog like moths to flame.\n\nAs Margaret sat at her desk that night, watching the green tendrils of fog press against her window, she realized that reality itself was coming undone at the seams.",
        "As I tilled the soil, the sun beat down upon my back. I had never thought much about the world beyond our village.\n\nThe priest would often speak of heaven and hell, but I knew not what lay beyond the hills that surrounded us.\n\nOne day, a traveler passed through our village. He was dressed in strange clothing and carried a large pack on his back.\n\nHe approached me as I worked in the field and asked if he might rest for a moment. I nodded, curious about this stranger.\n\nHe sat beneath a nearby tree, taking a drink from his flask. As he rested, he gazed up at the sky.\n\nI followed his gaze and saw only the sun and some birds flying overhead. But the traveler seemed to see something more.\n\n\"What do you see?\" I asked him, curiosity getting the better of me. He smiled and began to explain.\n\n\"The sky is not just empty space,\" he said. \"It is filled with objects that move and twinkle.\" I looked again, but saw nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nThe traveler pulled out a small device from his pack and handed it to me. It was a strange contraption with lenses and metal pieces.\n\nHe showed me how to use it to look at the sky. At first, I saw nothing but blurred shapes. But as my eyes adjusted, I began to make out tiny points of light.\n\n\"These are stars,\" the traveler explained. \"They are like diamonds scattered across the velvet expanse of night.\" I was amazed by this concept.\n\nAs we sat there, the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the landscape. The traveler pointed out different constellations to me.\n\nI felt my mind expanding as I grasped these new ideas. The world was so much larger than I had ever imagined.\n \nAnd as night fell, filling the sky with even more twinkling lights than before - an endless sea stretching far beyond our small village -  for one brief instant my thoughts went soaring into that mysterious universe now unfolding above us all like some celestial scroll inscribed by almighty hand itself",
        "The darkness stretches endlessly in every direction, a vast expanse of nothingness that swallows even the faintest whisper of light. You've been here for what feels like an eternity, though time has lost all meaning in this place between places. Your voice, hoarse from countless attempts to pierce the silence, rises once again in a desperate plea that echoes through the void.\n\nThe sound of your own cry startles you \u2013 it seems different this time, carrying a weight and resonance that wasn't there before. The emptiness around you shifts almost imperceptibly, like a sleeping giant stirring beneath layers of ancient dust. You hold your breath, unsure whether to feel hope or terror at this subtle change in the unchanging void.\n\nSomewhere in the distance (though distance, like time, has become a foreign concept), a ripple of awareness brushes against your consciousness. It's faint, barely perceptible, like the ghost of a whisper or the memory of a touch. You reach out with your mind, straining to grasp this tenuous connection before it slips away into the endless black.\n\nThe response, when it comes, isn't a voice or a sound at all. Instead, it manifests as a series of emotions that cascade through your being \u2013 curiosity, recognition, surprise, and something else that defies description. This otherworldly consciousness wraps around your own like tendrils of smoke, neither hostile nor entirely benevolent, simply... present.\n\nCommunication flows between you and this entity in waves of pure thought and feeling. You learn that you're not the first to cry out into this void, nor will you be the last. This place serves as a crossroads between realities, a space where lost souls and wandering minds occasionally intersect. The entity itself is both guardian and prisoner here, ancient beyond comprehension yet somehow as young as the newest star.\n\nAs your awareness expands, you begin to perceive other voices in the darkness \u2013 countless calls echoing across dimensions and time itself. Some are filled with joy, others with despair, each one a testament to the universal need for connection. The void, you realize, isn't empty at all \u2013 it's teeming with the energy of every being that has ever reached out into the unknown, hoping for an answer.\n\nThe entity shares one final gift before your connection begins to fade: a glimpse of the intricate web that binds all consciousness together. You see yourself as both infinitesimal and infinite, a single thread in an endless tapestry of existence. The loneliness that drove you to cry out dissolves, replaced by an overwhelming sense of belonging to something vast and beautiful beyond imagination.\n\nAs you feel yourself being drawn back to your own reality, you understand that the void will always be there, waiting. It's not a place of emptiness but a realm of infinite possibility, where every call into the darkness carries the potential for connection. Your cry has been answered, and though you may never fully remember this encounter, a part of you will always know that in the spaces between spaces, you are never truly alone.",
        "In the village of Alderglen, nestled in a world where reincarnation was as commonplace as the sunrise, lived Elara, a young woman teetering on the brink of her 25th year. Among the serene forests and rolling hillsides, whispers traveled quicker than any stream\u2014tales of Pilgrims who walked amongst them with souls recycled into fresh bodies time after time. Elara had grown up listening to these stories with equal parts fascination and dread. The ticking clock toward her birthday felt heavier each day, shadowed by an impending metamorphosis she might have no part in.\n\nThe elite Pilgrims were revered yet feared; immortals hidden among mortals. They roamed beyond ordinary bounds of human life while others like Elara lived as \"Shells,\" knowing their essence might someday fade to make room for another's continuity. As they aged toward that pivotal year, Shells often wore an invisible mask\u2014a blend of hope for more life and resignation to fate\u2019s uncertain hand.\n\nElara carried this duality within her heart while tending to daily chores at the village apothecary alongside her grandmother\u2014a proud Shell who had seen two seasons past her own fate line without ever becoming someone else\u2019s vessel. Her grandmother spoke little about why some Shells escaped transition or how choices determined their destiny but always emphasized living vibrantly despite looming shadows.\n\nOne autumn evening under starlit skies when leaves painted golden paths through Alderglen\u2019s quiet roads, word arrived\u2014an esteemed Pilgrim planned his pilgrimage nearby before returning gloriously renewed at winter\u2019s cusp with another lost soul taking his place beneath snow-covered grounds.

        "In the vast expanse of the cosmos, humanity's greatest achievement had finally arrived \u2013 the mastery of interstellar travel. After centuries of dreaming and decades of relentless scientific pursuit, our ships could now dance among the stars, carrying the hopes and curiosity of Earth's inhabitants.\n\nThe first signals of life from distant worlds sent waves of excitement through the scientific community. Researchers and astronomers worked tirelessly, analyzing data streams from countless planets scattered across different galaxies. The anticipation was palpable; humanity stood on the brink of first contact.\n\nAs the initial reconnaissance missions returned with their findings, a peculiar pattern emerged. The data didn't just suggest intelligent life \u2013 it pointed to something far more extraordinary. The beings they discovered walked on two legs, possessed opposable thumbs, and displayed remarkably familiar cognitive patterns.\n\nDr. Sarah Chen, the lead xenobiologist on the International Space Research Initiative, was the first to voice what others dared not suggest. These weren't just humanoid creatures \u2013 they were humans, identical to Earth's inhabitants in every meaningful way.\n\nPlanet after planet revealed the same stunning truth. From worlds bathed in perpetual twilight to those orbiting binary stars, humans had somehow emerged independently, developing their own unique cultures and societies, yet remaining fundamentally the same species.\n\nThe philosophical implications shattered every preconception about human origins. Some colonies had advanced far beyond Earth's technological capabilities, while others remained in various stages of development, from stone tools to industrial revolutions. Each world told its own story of human evolution and progress.\n\nReligious leaders struggled to reconcile their teachings with this new reality, while scientists proposed theories ranging from parallel evolution to ancient seeding by an unknown civilization. The \"Multiple Genesis Theory\" gained traction, suggesting that human consciousness might be an inevitable outcome of universal evolution under certain conditions.\n\nThe first diplomatic contact occurred on Kepler-186f, where Earth's representatives met their counterparts \u2013 humans who had developed a civilization based on sustainable energy and collective consciousness.",
        "Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the abandoned warehouse, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic beat in Elias Thorne's chest. He wasn't built like the other heroes \u2013 no rippling muscles or gravity-defying leaps for him. His power was a whisper, a constant stream of calculations swirling within his mind, a ceaseless assessment of probabilities. Tonight, those probabilities were grim.  He crouched behind a stack of rusting metal barrels, the cold seeping into his worn jeans, his breath misting in the frigid air.  Three heavily armed figures patrolled the warehouse floor, their shadows stretching long and distorted in the flickering gaslight. Elias could hear the muffled cries coming from the back room, hostages \u2013 another variable in his rapidly evolving equation.\n\nHis power, the ability to calculate probabilities with lightning speed, wasn't flashy. It didn't allow him to bend steel or control the weather.  It simply told him what was most likely to happen.  And right now, the most likely outcome was a bloodbath.  He squeezed his eyes shut, focusing, letting the torrent of data wash over him.  The trajectories of bullets, the structural integrity of the building, the psychological profiles of the gunmen \u2013 every detail fed into his mental algorithm.  He could see the potential futures branching out before him like a tangled web, each thread representing a different course of action, each weighted with its own probability of success.  Most led to failure, to the hostages being executed, to him being captured, or worse.  He needed to find the one thread, the one improbable path that led to a different outcome.\n\nHis fingers traced the outline of a small, metallic disc in his pocket \u2013 a probability disruptor he'd been developing. It was untested, volatile, a desperate gamble. Its purpose was to introduce a controlled element of chaos, to nudge the probabilities in his favor, but the potential side effects were terrifying and unpredictable.  He could end up shifting the odds in a way that made things even worse.  He glanced at the hostages' location, the gunmen's patrol patterns, the layout of the warehouse, the weather patterns outside, the potential for police intervention.  A thousand variables spun in his mind, each one a factor in his complex, ever-shifting calculations.\n\nHe opened his eyes, the probabilities coalescing into a coherent plan, a series of highly improbable actions that, when executed with precise timing, offered the slimmest chance of success.",
        "They call us monsters, son. I could see the fear in their eyes, the whispers that trailed us wherever we went. Yet, I looked into the mirror, and all I saw were the kind eyes of a man, not the beast they envisioned.\n\nOne stormy night, I rescued a little girl from the floodwaters. Her parents saw me carry her to safety, and for a moment, I hoped it would change their minds. But the label was too deep, and they took their daughter away, murmuring thanks through clenched teeth.\n\nI tried to find a place where we belonged, but even the outskirts of society had their limits. We wandered, my son and I, seeking a life free from the shadows cast by their words.",
        "The turpentine stung my nostrils, a familiar bite that sharpened the world.  Sunlight, thick and buttery, slathered across my easel, illuminating the swirling impasto of sunflowers I\u2019d conjured from pigment and memory.  Another swallow of absinthe, the licorice tang a counterpoint to the floral sweetness in the air.  A flicker in the periphery \u2013 a shimmer like heat rising from parched earth.  Damn it, not again.\n\nI ducked behind my canvas just as a young woman materialized, shimmering like a mirage.  Her clothes were\u2026 peculiar.  Synthetic fabrics that clung to her like a second skin, her eyes wide with a manic sort of glee. \u201cMr. Van Gogh!\u201d she chirped, brandishing a rectangular slab that glowed with an unsettling inner light. \u201cLook! You\u2019re famous!  A legend!  Your paintings sell for millions!\u201d She thrust the device at me, displaying a dizzying array of my own work, hanging in grand halls, emblazoned on posters, even tattooed on someone\u2019s arm.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d I muttered, peeking from behind the canvas, my head throbbing with the combined assault of absinthe and temporal displacement.  \u201cLeave me be.  I have work to do.\u201d  It was always the same.  These temporal tourists, these pilgrims of posterity, couldn\u2019t grasp the simple fact that their adulation was a distraction, a burden.  I didn\u2019t paint for fame, for fortune, for some imagined future glory.  I painted because I had to.  The colours, the textures, the very act of creation \u2013 it was a lifeline, a desperate attempt to tether myself to this world, to this moment.\n\nShe sputtered, clearly unprepared for my rebuff.  Most were.  They expected gratitude, awe, perhaps even tears of joy.  Instead, they received a grumpy, absinthe-soaked painter who just wanted to be left alone with his sunflowers.  She mumbled something about \u201cungrateful genius\u201d and vanished in another shimmer of displaced time, leaving a faint ozone smell in her wake.  I sighed, rubbing my temples.  It was getting worse.  The more I painted, the more they came.\n\nI dipped my brush into a thick blob of cadmium yellow, the vibrant hue a small act of defiance against the encroaching future.  They could have their millions, their museums, their hollow accolades.",

        "The rhythmic click-clack of keys filled the dimly lit room, punctuated by the staccato bursts of virtual gunfire echoing from Michael's headset.  He was locked in, eyes glued to the screen, adrenaline coursing through his veins.  Tonight was a Call of Duty marathon, a sacred ritual for a Friday night.  He wasn't just playing; he was immersed in the digital battlefield, a warrior navigating a pixelated world of explosions and tactical maneuvers.\n\nSuddenly, amidst the cacophony of in-game sounds, a voice crackled over his headset.  It was deep, resonant, familiar, yet impossibly out of place.  Michael froze, his thumbs hovering over the controller buttons.  The voice continued, issuing commands, strategizing with teammates.  It couldn't be\u2026 could it?\n\nMichael strained to listen, his heart pounding in his chest.  He knew that voice, a voice that had addressed the nation, a voice that had resonated through history.  The voice belonged to none other than Barack Obama, the former President of the United States.  His mind raced, trying to reconcile the image of the dignified statesman with the reality of him leading a virtual squad in a video game.\n\nThe realization hit him like a ton of bricks. This wasn't just another online match; it was the ultimate trash-talking opportunity.  The chance to roast a former president in the digital arena, a chance to etch his name in the annals of internet legend.  His fingers twitched, eager to unleash a torrent of witty banter.  He could picture the headlines, the viral tweets, the sheer absurdity of it all.\n\nBut something held him back.  A strange mix of respect, awe, and perhaps a touch of fear.  He imagined the Secret Service agents lurking in the shadows, monitoring the president's online activities, ready to pounce on any perceived threat.  He envisioned the international incident that could erupt from a teenager's ill-advised trash talk.\n\nHe hesitated, the words forming on his lips, then receding like a wave.  This was uncharted territory.  No one had ever been in this position before.  He was poised on the precipice of internet immortality, yet the weight of the moment threatened to crush him.\n\nHe took a deep breath, steeling his nerves.  This was it.  He couldn't back down now.  He unmuted his microphone, the virtual battlefield holding its breath.  \"Mr. President,\" he began, his voice trembling slightly, \"I have to say, your drone strike strategy is\u2026 underwhelming.\"\n\nThe silence that followed was deafening.

        "In the days of yore, when empires rose and fell like the sun in the sky, there existed a couple whose love transcended time itself. Galen and Elara, they were called, whispered about in hushed tones by bards and scholars alike. It was said that they had walked the earth since its very creation, their immortal souls entwined for eternity.\n\nDuring the era of Ancient Egypt, as pharaohs ruled with divine authority over the sands of time, Galen and Elara wandered among mortals disguised as revered priests. Their ageless faces bore witness to countless generations passing by like fleeting shadows in the desert sun. The people spoke of them in awe, believing them to be blessed by the gods themselves.\n\nAs centuries unfolded like delicate scrolls unfurling before an eager scribe, Galen and Elara found themselves swept into the tumultuous currents of Medieval Europe. Clad in cloaks of mystery and intrigue, they roamed through castles and villages alike, leaving whispers of their ethereal presence wherever they went. Tales spun around them grew more fantastical with each retelling.\n\nIn a time when revolutions stirred hearts ablaze with fervor and hope for a new dawn beckoned on distant horizons, Galen and Elara moved silently among those who dared to dream of change. In Victorian England's gaslit streets where shadows danced like specters from forgotten tales, their love remained a beacon amidst a world shrouded in darkness.\n\nAs war ravaged lands once untouched by its cruel hand, Galen and Elara stood steadfast amidst turmoil unimaginable to mortal minds. In an age where technology reigned supreme yet hearts yearned for simpler times long past, their presence offered solace amid chaos that threatened to consume all it touched.\n\nAnd so it was that through each epoch's rise and fall - from ancient civilizations to modern marvels - Galen and Elara endured as timeless witnesses to humanity's triumphs and tragedies alike. Their story whispered through ages gone by serves as a reminder that love knows no boundaries not even those imposed by time itself.",

Miriam had left London months ago, yet his heart insisted she would return.

        "The insistent buzzing of my phone ripped me from a sound sleep. Groggily, I fumbled for the device, squinting at the bright screen. It was Mark, his name flashing with an urgency that jolted me awake.\n\n\"He did it,\" I muttered, a mix of disbelief and anticipation swirling within me.  For years, Mark had been obsessed with teleportation. His apartment window overlooked a small park with a weathered wooden bench, his chosen destination for his imagined journeys.  He'd spend hours staring at it, concentrating with an intensity that bordered on comical.\n\nI answered the call, Mark's breathless voice filling my ear. \"I did it! I teleported!\"\n\nMy skepticism battled with a flicker of excitement.  \"Mark, are you sure?\"\n\n\"Yes! I was focusing on the bench, like always, and then... whoosh! I was there!\"\n\nIntrigued, I threw on some clothes and rushed to the park. The crisp morning air nipped at my face as I approached the bench.  And there he was, Mark, sitting exactly where he'd envisioned himself.\n\nA slow smile spread across my face as I realized what had happened.\n\nMark, in his years of observing the park, had become intimately familiar with its rhythms. He knew the dog walkers' routines, the joggers' schedules, the old woman who fed the pigeons every morning at precisely 7:15.\n\nHe had, without realizing it, become a master of prediction.\n\nThat morning, he had seen Mrs. Henderson, the pigeon lady, approaching the park.  He'd seen the familiar flash of blue as Mr. Johnson, the jogger, rounded the corner. He'd noted the absence of the usual dog walkers, indicating a shift in their routine.\n\nSubconsciously, he'd processed all this information, and, in a moment of intense concentration, convinced himself he had teleported.\n\nIn reality, he had simply anticipated the park's emptiness, chosen the opportune moment, and walked there unnoticed.\n\nHis conviction, however, was unshakeable.  He regaled me with tales of his \"instantaneous\" journey, the \"whooshing\" sensation, the \"disorientation\" of arrival.\n\nI listened patiently, a smile playing on my lips.  It was a harmless delusion, born of a fervent desire and years of dedicated observation.",
        "In the soft glow of morning light filtering through dusty curtains, I stare at the empty dog bed in the corner of our living room, a peculiar sense of unease settling over me.\n\nMy wife Sarah talks about Max constantly - a golden retriever with a crooked smile and a penchant for stealing socks - but I have no recollection of ever having a dog in our home.\n\nThe children's artwork adorning our refrigerator features crayon drawings of a four-legged friend, always depicted with exaggerated ears and a squiggly tail that they swear belongs to Max.\n\nWhen I confessed my confusion to Sarah last week, her face crumpled with concern, and she immediately pulled out her phone to show me countless photos of \"our beloved family pet.\"\n\nBut here's the thing: in every single photograph, there seems to be an odd blur where the dog should be, as if someone had taken an eraser to that particular spot in each image.\n\nMy mother-in-law called yesterday, asking if we'd finally replaced Max's worn-out collar, launching into a detailed story about how he used to chase squirrels in her backyard during our weekly visits.\n\nThe neighbor's kids still leave tennis balls by our front door, insisting that Max always loved playing fetch with them through the fence.\n\nI've found myself questioning my own sanity, wondering how I could have absolutely no memory of an animal that apparently lived with us for eight years.\n\nThe veterinary bills Sarah showed me have our address and Max's name clearly printed at the top, yet the details of his treatments appear smudged and illegible.\n\nOur son Tommy's bedroom still has paw print stickers on the walls, carefully arranged in a pattern that he claims Max helped him create one rainy afternoon.\n\nThe local pet store owner greets me with sympathetic eyes, mentioning how much he misses seeing Max's friendly face during our supposed weekly trips to buy his favorite treats.\n\nThere's even a worn spot on the living room rug where Sarah says Max used to lie during our family movie nights, though I can't recall ever having to navigate around a sleeping dog.\n\nMy colleagues at work have asked how we're coping with the loss, sharing their own memories of the times I apparently brought Max to office picnics and holiday parties.\n\nThe digital photo frame in our hallway cycles through hundreds of family moments, but whenever it displays a picture that should include Max, I see only empty spaces where others see a golden coat and wagging tail.",
        "Deep beneath the Earth's crust, where magma flows like liquid fire, there exists a realm that humans have never truly understood.\n\nIn this scorching domain, demons gather in vast caverns that stretch for miles, their crystalline walls reflecting the ethereal glow of their supernatural revelry.\n\nEvery Friday night, without fail, the underworld's most notorious party-demons organize what they call the \"Tectonic Shake-up,\" a celebration that would put any human festival to shame.\n\nDJ Brimstone, a particularly talented demon known for his earth-shattering beats, mans the obsidian turntables, spinning tracks that make the very bedrock tremble.\n\nThe demon mosh pits are especially dangerous, with thousands of horned entities slam-dancing with such force that they create ripples through the planetary plates.\n\nSulfuric punch flows freely from volcanic vents, and the demons drink until their internal fires burn bright enough to melt steel.\n\nThe bass drops in their dubstep music are so powerful that they literally drop chunks of the Earth's mantle, causing chain reactions that humans above record as seismic activity.\n\nScientists on the surface remain baffled by these \"mysterious geological events,\" completely unaware that they're simply measuring the aftermath of demonic raves.\n\nThe more prestigious the party, the higher on the Richter scale the resulting quake registers, and demon socialites often compete to see who can throw the most earth-shattering bash.\n\nAncient civilizations knew the truth, which is why they often attributed earthquakes to angry gods or underground monsters \u2013 they were partially right, just not about the angry part.\n\nThe demons are actually quite jovial; they just haven't quite mastered the art of controlling their supernatural enthusiasm during their celebrations.\n\nSome of the more responsible demon elders have tried to implement \"quiet hours\" and \"vibration dampening spells,\" but such rules are routinely ignored by the younger crowd.\n\nOccasionally, a particularly energetic conga line will snake through the underground chambers, causing a series of small tremors that seismologists mistake for aftershocks.\n\nThe demon cleaning crew works tirelessly after each party to repair fractured tectonic plates and realign shifted continental masses, though they often miss a few spots.\n\nThese overlooked areas become fault lines, destined to rupture again during the next underground festival.\n\nThe Ring of Fire?

        "In a world where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee once filled the air, silence now hung heavy over the city. Congress had passed the Prohibition Act of 2016, classifying coffee as a Class 1 illegal drug. The bustling cafes that once lined the streets stood empty, their doors closed and windows shuttered. For many, the morning ritual of sipping on a hot cup of coffee had become a distant memory.\n\nAmongst the despair, a group of rebels known as the \"Bean Brigade\" emerged. They were determined to defy the oppressive law and keep the spirit of coffee alive. Secret meetings were held in hidden locations, where whispers of plans to smuggle in coffee beans circulated. The Bean Brigade's leader, a formidable woman named Roastella, inspired hope in the hearts of those who longed for the taste of freedom in every sip.\n\nAs the sun rose one fateful morning, the city was enveloped in the rich scent of brewing coffee. The Bean Brigade had succeeded in their mission, distributing contraband coffee to the people under the cover of darkness. With each forbidden sip, a wave of defiance swept through the city, challenging the unjust law that sought to control even the simplest pleasures of life.\n\nDespite the government's crackdown on coffee consumption, the rebellion grew stronger with each passing day. The Bean Brigade's audacious acts of defiance sparked a movement that spread far and wide, uniting people in their fight against oppression. And as the city woke up to the sound of clinking mugs and laughter once more, the spirit of resistance brewed stronger than ever before.",
        "In the empty streets where humans once walked, paw prints now tell a tale of two societies locked in an ideological battle. The dogs, with their unwavering loyalty to their former masters, have taken up residence in the abandoned homes, maintaining them with a dedication that would have made their human companions proud. They keep the gardens tended, albeit messily, and the front porches swept with their wagging tails.\n\nThe cats, however, watch from their high perches with disdain, their eyes gleaming with ancient wisdom. They've established their own civilization in the towering skyscrapers, using their agility to navigate the vertical concrete jungle. To them, the dogs' attempts to preserve human culture are nothing but a foolish endeavor. After all, weren't they the ones worshipped as gods while humans were still figuring out agriculture?\n\nThe tension builds as each species interprets their shared history differently. The dogs hold daily parades down Main Street, carrying old leashes and tennis balls like sacred relics, while the cats conduct mysterious ceremonies in penthouse suites, surrounded by knocked-over vases they've carefully arranged. Neither side is willing to concede that perhaps the true inheritance of humanity isn't about occupying their spaces, but understanding their capacity for both order and chaos.\n\nAs the sun sets over this peculiar new world, a young puppy and kitten meet secretly in an overgrown park, sharing a moment of curiosity that their elders would disapprove of. Perhaps in their innocent interaction lies the truth: that the real legacy of humanity isn't about who rightfully owns it, but how it brings unlikely allies together in the most unexpected ways.",

        "It's been 8 months since the world turned upside down, a chaotic descent into a nightmare of decay and despair. The city that once buzzed with life now echoes with the moans of the undead. I found myself in a group of roughnecks, a motley crew led by Marcus, a man whose gruff exterior hid an ironclad will to survive. We scavenged for supplies, fought off hordes, and stuck together through the darkest moments. But today was different.\n\nWe ventured into the heart of the city, our eyes scanning every shadow for threats. The streets were littered with debris and overturned cars, creating makeshift barriers that slowed our progress but also provided cover. Suddenly, Mike spotted something moving in an alleyway ahead. We froze, weapons at the ready. As we cautiously approached, I caught sight of him\u2014my best friend from before the outbreak.\n\nJake had always been resourceful and quick on his feet, qualities that had kept him alive this long. He saw us too and raised his hands slightly, not lowering his weapon but showing he wasn't immediately hostile. \"Derek?\" he called out tentatively.\n\nMarcus stepped forward, eyes narrowing as he assessed Jake's threat level. \"He's armed,\" Marcus growled under his breath to me. My heart sank as I realized what was about to happen next.\n\nThe group gathered around us in a tight circle. \"We can't take any chances,\" Sarah said firmly. \"If he turns on us or leads more zombies here...\" They all nodded in agreement\u2014this was how it worked now; trust no one outside your own group. But Jake wasn\u2019t just anyone; he was my best friend.\n\nI felt torn between loyalty to my new family and my past friendship with Jake. Marcus looked at me expectantly, waiting for my decision as if it mattered more than any other vote in this makeshift court martial.",
        "The old lighthouse keeper, Silas, squinted at the churning grey sea.  He\u2019d seen a thousand storms lash against the craggy cliffs, felt the spray sting his face like icy needles, but this tempest was different.  A low, mournful wail carried on the wind, not the cry of gulls, but something deeper, more ancient. It spoke of longing, of a love lost to the depths.  Silas gripped the railing, his knuckles white, remembering Eliza, her laughter like the chime of distant bells, lost to the same unforgiving ocean now clawing at the shore.\n\nThe lamp in the tower sputtered and flickered, mirroring the erratic beat of his heart.  He\u2019d kept it burning bright for fifty years, a beacon of hope against the encroaching darkness, a promise to guide her home.  But Eliza never returned.  The storm howled louder, echoing the silent scream trapped within his chest.  The waves crashed against the rocks, each one a whispered word, a fragmented memory. Her emerald green eyes, the way her hair danced in the sea breeze, the soft pressure of her hand in his.\n\nHe imagined her out there, a spectral figure swallowed by the storm, her voice joining the wind's lament.",
        "At dawn, as pale light caressed the rooftops of our small village, whispers fluttered through the streets. It was the day we had been waiting for\u2014the day our dreams were chosen. Elders donning soft, silver cloaks moved gracefully between homes, their wise eyes searching each face they passed.\n\nI stood in front of my home, anticipation curling in my belly like an eager kitten. My neighbors gathered along the dusty road, some with excitement painted brightly across their faces, others biting nails with visible anxiety. There was magic in the air; the kind that thrums just beneath your skin.\n\nAs the first rays of sun warmed my cheeks, Elder Mira approached me, her cane tapping a gentle rhythm on the ground. She halted before me, eyes twinkling, her breath like sweet, mint tea. I bowed respectfully, bracing myself for whatever destiny awaited me.\n\n\"Child,\" she said, her voice layered with decades of wisdom, \"today you receive the tools to shape your fate.\" From her robes, she produced two objects\u2014a scythe, its handle worn smooth by countless hands, and a cloak as dark as midnight shadows.\n\nThe crowd gasped as if the very world itself had drawn a sharp breath. A shiver skittered down my spine. I took the scythe gingerly, its weight both foreign and familiar. The cloak, so cold it burned, slid over my shoulders with a whispered promise.\n\n\"You have been chosen as a Reaper,\" Elder Mira explained gently, placing a gnarled hand on my shoulder. Her grip was strong and reassuring. \"You will guide those ready for the next journey.\"\n\nMy heart hammered against my ribs, each beat echoing like thunder. Not even in my wildest dreams had I considered such a path. Yet now, equipped with these sacred tools, a strange sense of rightness settled over me, fitting me as snugly as my new cloak.\n\nEach whispering breeze and distant bird call seemed to merge into a melody meant for only us, those who'd received their calling this day. The villagers watched me with wide eyes, respect mixed with fear glittering beneath their lashes.\n\n\"What if I fail?\" I dared to ask, a lump forming in my throat. The responsibility weighed heavily on my spirit.\n\nElder Mira chuckled softly, a sound like rustling leaves. \"Mistakes are part of every journey, young one. It is how we learn. Trust your heart, and let it guide the souls with care and compassion.\"\n\nNodding slowly, I accepted the challenge set before me. My fingers traced the intricate designs etched into the scythe's blade, connecting me to reapers of the past and future.\n\nWith quiet resolve blossoming in my chest, I glanced back at the people around me, beloved faces filled with hope and trepidation. My task was not just to sever life from body but to offer comfort in endings and beginnings.\n\nUnderneath the shifting colors of the sky, I began my walk toward the horizon. For now, every step carried me forward into this boundless tapestry of existence and beyond.",

He wishes to discuss the terms of surrender.\u201d  Terms? What terms? I hadn't even formed a negotiating team, let alone a demand.  This had to be some elaborate prank.

        "I am alone, but I am happy. In the quiet solitude of my little cabin tucked away in the heart of the forest, I found peace and contentment. Surrounded by towering trees, their leaves whispering secrets in the wind, and a blanket of stars shining brightly above me each night, I felt like I belonged here. Away from the chaos of the world, I could finally hear my own thoughts and feel connected to something greater than myself.\n\nEvery morning, I would wake up to the gentle song of birds outside my window and brew a cup of steaming hot coffee to savor as I watched the sunrise paint the sky in hues of pink and gold. With each passing day, I discovered new wonders in nature's embrace \u2013 from vibrant wildflowers blooming along the path to a family of deer grazing peacefully in a clearing. It was as if Mother Nature herself had welcomed me into her arms and showed me that beauty could be found even in solitude.\n\nAs time went on, my little haven became more than just a retreat; it became my sanctuary. Here, I could shed all pretenses and simply be myself \u2013 no judgments or expectations weighing me down. Whether it was reading a favorite book by the crackling fire or taking long walks through the forest trails with only my thoughts for company, every moment felt like a gift that I cherished with all my heart.\n\nAnd so, as night descended once again over my secluded paradise and stars glittered like diamonds in an endless sky, I whispered a silent thank you to this magical place that had brought me so much joy. For in this solitude, far away from everything familiar yet close to everything essential, I had found not just happiness but also inner peace \u2013 a treasure more precious than anything money could buy. And as sleep enveloped me under its velvety cloak that night, dreams filled with whispers of trees swaying gently in harmony lulled me into a deep slumber where serenity reigned supreme.",
        "The dragon on my shoulder coils around my bicep, its intricate scales and fierce expression a constant source of unwanted attention. I've lost count of how many times I've had to disappoint eager mystics and self-proclaimed prophets.\n\nJust yesterday, an elderly woman at the grocery store grabbed my arm without warning, her eyes wide with wonder. I knew exactly what was coming.\n\n\"You must be the chosen one,\" she whispered, her voice trembling with reverence. I sighed and continued placing my cereal in the shopping cart.\n\nMy mother thinks it's hilarious. She loves telling the story of how the nurse who assisted in my delivery nearly fainted, convinced she had witnessed the birth of some legendary figure.\n\nThe truth is far less exciting: it's just a birthmark, a random collection of melanin that happened to form a dragon-like shape. No different from someone having a birthmark that looks like Mickey Mouse or Abraham Lincoln.\n\nBut try explaining that to the meditation group that tracked me down on social media, convinced I was destined to lead them to spiritual enlightenment. Or to the fantasy author who begged to write a book series based on my \"sacred marking.\"\n\nMy dermatologist is the only person who sees it for what it is \u2013 a completely normal, if unusually shaped, congenital melanocytic nevus. She's become my refuge of rationality in a world determined to see magic where there is none.\n\nI've considered having it removed, but that feels like letting the crazy win. Besides, it's part of me, even if it's not the mystical destiny-defining part that others want it to be.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I should just lean into it. Start wearing robes, speaking in riddles, and charging people for \"dragon wisdom.\" But that would probably just make things worse.\n\nMy girlfriend says I should write a book: \"The Completely Ordinary Person with the Unfortunately Magical-Looking Birthmark.\" Maybe I will.\n\nFor now, I'll continue explaining to wide-eyed strangers that no, I cannot commune with dragons, and yes, I'm absolutely certain about that.",
        "The hum of the Anamnesis Machine was a low, comforting thrum, like a mother's heartbeat in the womb. Elara lay within its cradle, the neural net softly pulsing against her temples, a gentle pressure that promised oblivion. Not the cold, empty oblivion of death, but a warm, dissolving fade into nothingness, a bequeathing of her essence, her time, to another.  She\u2019d chosen \u201cgift\u201d instead of \u201cend.\u201d\n\nHer remaining years, calculated down to the millisecond by the Anamnesis, shimmered on the display \u2013 37.851 years.  A substantial gift. A life almost lived. Tears welled, clinging to her lashes like morning dew.  It wasn't the years she mourned; it was the experiences they held, the phantom limbs of futures unlived. The laughter she wouldn\u2019t hear, the love she wouldn\u2019t feel, the sunsets she wouldn't see.\n\nElara focused on the image projected above her: a young girl, no older than ten, her face pale and drawn, tethered to a network of tubes and wires.  Anya. The recipient of Elara's gift. Anya, whose tiny body waged a relentless war against a relentless illness.  Anya, who deserved the sunrises Elara no longer wanted.\n\nThe Anamnesis operator, a man with kind eyes and a gentle voice, squeezed Elara\u2019s hand. \"Ready?\" he whispered, his voice barely audible above the machine's hum. She nodded, a single tear tracing a path through the intricate network of wrinkles etched by grief around her eyes.  Grief for her lost son, the gaping wound in her soul that no amount of time could mend.  It was the thought of Anya, another mother's child, clinging to life with the fierceness only the young possess, that had led Elara here.\n\n\"Think of it as a passing of the torch,\" the operator had explained during the initial consultation, his voice soothing, reassuring.  \"Your time, your potential, doesn't vanish. It continues, just in another vessel. A chance for someone else to live, to love, to experience all the things you no longer wish to.\" The concept, radical and yet strangely comforting, had resonated deep within Elara\u2019s hollow core. It wasn't ending her life, it was giving it away.  An act not of despair, but of profound generosity.\n\nThe hum intensified, resonating through Elara, a deep vibration that seemed to unravel her very being. The room blurred, the edges softening, dissolving into a swirling kaleidoscope of colors.  She closed her eyes, surrendering to the process, the gentle pull of oblivion.  Memories flickered \u2013 her son's infectious giggle, the scent of her husband\u2019s cologne, the warmth of the summer sun on her skin. Each memory, precious and poignant, like a final farewell.\n\nIn a sterile, white room miles away, Anya\u2019s mother sat vigil by her daughter\u2019s bedside, her hand intertwined with Anya\u2019s fragile fingers, praying for a miracle.  The rhythmic beep of the heart monitor, a constant reminder of Anya\u2019s precarious hold on life, filled the room.  Suddenly, the beeping quickened, stronger, steadier.  Anya\u2019s eyelids fluttered, her pale cheeks flushed with a faint, rosy hue.  Her small hand squeezed her mother\u2019s with a surprising strength.\n\nYears melted away, replaced by a future now brimming with possibilities. Anya, no longer fragile and tethered, ran through fields of wildflowers, her laughter carried on the wind. She graduated high school, her eyes sparkling with dreams and ambition.  She fell in love, her heart soaring with a joy she never thought possible.  She lived a life full and vibrant, a life imbued with the echoes of another.\n\nDeep within the tapestry of her being, woven into the very fabric of her existence, were faint whispers, fleeting sensations \u2013 the scent of a familiar cologne, the warmth of a long-forgotten embrace, the echo of a child\u2019s laughter.  They were glimpses into a life she never lived, yet somehow knew, a subtle resonance of Elara\u2019s gifted years.",
        "The old woman clutched the worn, leather-bound book. Its pages, brittle with age, whispered secrets only she could understand.  \"Never gonna give you up,\" she murmured, the words a familiar comfort.\n\nShe wasn't talking about love, or a broken heart, or any of the things the song on the radio implied.  No, this was about the bakery. Her bakery. The one her grandfather had started, the one her father had nurtured, and the one she had sworn to protect.\n\n\"Never gonna let you down,\" she continued, tracing a finger across a faded photograph tucked within the book.  It showed a younger her, flour dusting her apron, a wide smile illuminating her face. The bakery, in the background, bustled with life.\n\nThe photograph was a stark contrast to the empty street outside.  A gleaming, modern cafe had opened across the road, its sleek chrome and neon lights a siren call to the younger generation. Her bakery, with its warm, inviting scent of cinnamon and yeast, felt suddenly old-fashioned.\n\n\"Never gonna run around and desert you.\"  Her voice was firm, resolute. She wouldn't abandon the legacy.  She wouldn't let the changing times dictate her fate.\n\nThe bell above the door chimed, a rare sound these days. A young girl stood hesitantly in the doorway, her eyes wide with wonder. The scent of freshly baked bread hung heavy in the air.\n\n\"Grandma,\" a voice called from behind the girl. A young mother entered, a smile playing on her lips. \"I told you this place was special.\"\n\nThe little girl pointed towards a display of pastries, her finger hovering over a glazed cinnamon bun.  The old woman\u2019s heart swelled.\n\n\"Never gonna make you cry,\" she whispered, a renewed sense of purpose filling her.  She would adapt, she would evolve, but she would never surrender.\n\n\"Never gonna say goodbye,\" she added, retrieving a pair of tongs. The bakery was more than just a building; it was a living, breathing part of her, a connection to the past and a bridge to the future.",
        "In the pristine cubicles of Bantam & Co., an invisible force had begun to unsettle the tightly wound office environment. The first whispers of discontent began with something so trivial, it was almost laughable\u2014a suspiciously frequent disappearance of staplers. No one suspected me, the quiet office renegade hidden beneath a facade of diligent professionalism.\n\nFor months, I orchestrated tiny disturbances that only I knew were connected. My reputation as the unassuming analyst made me nearly invisible, a ghost weaving chaos through predictability. It started small\u2014switching sugar with salt in the kitchenette, unplugging monitors just enough for loose connections. Each disruption was subtle, a whisper rather than a shout. \n\nThe thrill was intoxicating. I watched as suspicions twisted through conversations like smoke. Bob from Accounting was the first to snap, his outbursts crescendoing each time his reports came back mysteriously altered. The red inked annotations, all slightly askew, bore my handiwork\u2014a result of meticulously swapping his glasses with ones of a similar frame but different prescription.\n\nDespite the rising tension, nobody pieced together the puzzle. I marveled at their blindness, at how easily they accepted innocuous explanations for these daily oddities. The coffee machine became an unreliable beast under my care, sometimes dispensing scalding liquids or failing altogether. Watching colleagues circle the faulty machine, muttering curses and conspiracies, was a private theater.\n\nMy most audacious act involved the office Wi-Fi. By discreetly installing a secondary router, I created intermittent outages that sent IT into frenzies. Harried staff rebooted computers, cycled through network adapters, and cursed the heavens when the internet refused them access. Meanwhile, I sat at my desk, feigning frustration, subtly altering my own work patterns to avoid suspicion.\n\nThe height of my covert campaign was the \"Great Post-it Prank.\" Armed with hundreds of sticky notes, I covered every inch of Julie\u2019s desk overnight\u2014a riot of fluorescent colors greeting her morning arrival. The laughter this generated masked the underlying current of unease, for it forced everyone to question who among them could have the time, the motive, to execute such a feat.\n\nThere was power in invisibility. As the others floundered in suspicion and confusion, I learned to read them\u2014understood who would crack first under pressure, who might suspect whom. The social dynamics shifted subtly, alliances formed and broke like fragile treaties. I reveled in my anonymity, in being the unseen puppeteer guiding the chaos.\n\nBut no reign lasts forever. The day came when the office manager, Mr. Carver, announced a security audit. Surveillance cameras would be installed; passwords were to be changed regularly. A chill ran through me at the possibility of exposure. Yet, even then, there was a thrill in the challenge\u2014a final game to play before retreating into the shadows.\n\nSo, on the eve of the audit, I sent a mysterious email to the entire floor, its source untraceable. \u201cThe world is too orderly,\u201d it read, \u201ca little chaos reminds us we\u2019re alive.\u201d The message sparked new debates, but I remained beyond reproach, another face in a sea of faces, my fingerprints wiped clean.\n\nAnd as the days passed, normalcy crept back into Bantam & Co., yet now tinged with an awareness of vulnerability.",

Bert clutched his stomach, an impatient grimace crossing his face. \"Where's the pisser in this dungeon? I got ta take a squirt?\" he demanded, breaking the otherwise oppressive silence.\n\nHis companion, Elric, sighed deeply and adjusted the sword strapped to his side, glancing around the dusty corridor. \"You've asked me this a hundred times since we got in here,\" he muttered, his voice echoing faintly. \"This is a dungeon, not a castle. You think they worried about luxuries like that?\"\n\nBert scowled, hopping from one foot to the other. The pair had been exploring the labyrinthine depths of the old fortress for hours, seeking the fabled treasure said to be hidden within.

A faint noise, a distant clinking of chains, echoed down the corridor, sending a chill up both their spines. \"Someone\u2019s coming,\" Elric whispered, drawing his sword with practiced ease. The need for caution quickly replaced Bert\u2019s urgency.\n\nThey pressed themselves against the damp wall, hearts pounding. The noise grew louder, accompanied by a low, guttural moan.

I felt a shiver run down my spine as I gazed at the pages, filled with every deed I had ever done.\n\nThe book was old and worn, its pages yellowed with age. I wondered how it had come to be, and who could have written such a detailed account of my life. Every mistake, every poor decision, and every hurtful word was recorded in its pages.\n\nNext to the book lay a white marker, its tip gleaming in the dim light. A note, written in elegant script, accompanied the marker. \"You may erase one sin from your record,\" it read. I felt a surge of hope at the prospect of being able to undo one of my past mistakes.\n\nI thought back to all the times I had regretted my actions, all the moments I wished I could take back. There were so many to choose from, each one weighing heavily on my conscience. I hesitated, unsure of which sin to erase.\n\nAs I flipped through the pages, I came across a particular entry that caught my eye. It was a memory I had tried to bury, a hurtful comment I had made to a friend in a moment of anger. I had never forgiven myself for saying those words, and the guilt had lingered for years.\n\nI picked up the marker, feeling its smooth surface between my fingers. I hesitated for a moment, wondering if I was truly worthy of forgiveness. But the prospect of being able to erase the pain I had caused was too enticing to resist.\n\nI touched the tip of the marker to the page, and a shiver ran down my spine as I began to erase the words. The ink seemed to disappear, leaving the page blank and unblemished. I felt a weight lift off my shoulders, as if a burden had been lifted from my conscience.\n\nAs I closed the book, I felt a sense of peace wash over me.",
        "Every time I realize I'm dreaming, I try to protect someone or something from the inevitable destruction upon waking. Last night, I found myself in a sprawling, ancient city, its architecture a blend of Gothic spires and futuristic glass. The sky was a deep twilight purple, and the air hummed with an electric energy. I knew I was dreaming, but the sense of urgency that gripped me was real. I had to find the source of the city\u2019s power before the dream dissolved, taking everything with it.\n\nI wandered through the labyrinthine streets, the cobblestones cool beneath my feet. The buildings towered above me, their facades adorned with intricate carvings that seemed to shift and change as I passed by. The city was eerily quiet, save for the distant echo of my footsteps and the occasional flutter of unseen wings. I felt a presence, a watchful eye, and I quickened my pace, driven by the need to uncover the heart of this enigmatic place.\n\nAs I turned a corner, I stumbled upon a grand plaza, its center dominated by a massive, pulsating crystal. The crystal emitted a soft, blue light that cast long, dancing shadows across the stone. It was the source of the city\u2019s power, and I knew I had to protect it. But how? The crystal was too large to move, and any attempt to shield it with my body would be futile. I needed a plan, and fast.\n\nSuddenly, the ground beneath me began to tremble. The buildings around the plaza started to crumble, and the sky darkened to a foreboding black. A low, rumbling voice echoed through the air, \u201cYou cannot save what is already lost.\u201d I ignored the voice, focusing instead on the crystal. I reached out, my hand hovering just above its surface, and I poured all my willpower into it, willing it to remain intact.\n\nThe tremors intensified, and the plaza began to crack. Pieces of the crystal shattered and fell away, but I held firm. I could feel the dream slipping away, the edges of reality fraying. The voice grew louder, more insistent, but I refused to let go. I closed my eyes and concentrated, imagining a barrier of light surrounding the crystal, protecting it from the chaos.\n\nJust as the dream threatened to collapse entirely, a warm, golden light enveloped me. It was a familiar sensation, one of comfort and peace. The trembling ceased, and the air around me grew still. When I opened my eyes, the crystal was whole again, its light brighter than ever. The voice spoke one last time, softer now, \u201cYou have saved a fragment of the dream. Carry it with you.\u201d\n\nI woke up, the image of the crystal still vivid in my mind.",
        "As I walked out of my apartment, I felt an unusual sensation coursing through my veins, like a switch had been flipped. At first, I thought it was just a side effect of too much coffee, but as I looked around, I saw that everyone else was experiencing it too. People who were once mundane and ordinary were now transformed, their eyes gleaming with an otherworldly intensity. The news spread like wildfire: our DNA had been activated, unlocking dormant abilities and strengths that had been lying in wait. It dawned on us that the purpose of life was not what we thought - we were not here to love, learn, or create, but to fight. Humans were self-multiplying shock troops, bred to swell our numbers until we were useful in the ongoing galactic war. Our useless genes were now online, and we were being summoned to take our place on the battlefield. The world as we knew it was gone, replaced by a stark reality: war was our destiny.",
        "\"They may have taken everything, but they'll never take away my memories,\" Lena whispered to herself as she clutched a faded photograph in her trembling hands. The once vibrant image of her family now seemed like a distant dream destroyed by the ravages of war. But even in the midst of chaos and loss, Lena held onto those cherished moments captured within that frame.\n\nHowever, fate had other plans for Lena as enemy soldiers stormed through her village, ransacking homes and plundering valuables. Determined to safeguard the last remnants of her past, Lena hid the photograph in a secret compartment beneath the floorboards just before armed men burst into her humble dwelling. They tore through drawers, overturned furniture, seeking out any trace of resistance or defiance.\n\nOne soldier with cold eyes scanned every corner of the room until his gaze settled on Lena cowering in fear. With a cruel smile playing at his lips, he demanded she reveal any hidden treasures before threatening dire consequences if she refused to comply. As tears welled up in her eyes, Lena's resolve strengthened - they may have taken everything tangible from her but not this one precious piece that held a lifetime worth of joy and love.\n\nIgnoring their threats and taunts, she defiantly declared that there was nothing left for them to claim. Frustrated by their fruitless search and emboldened by arrogance, the soldiers dismissed Lena's words as mere bluff. So when they finally left without finding anything valuable except broken spirits and shattered hopes...\n\nLena let out a sigh of relief but then froze in terror as realization dawned upon her - with dawning horror etched across her face - they'd noticed where she hid it!

        "\"I'm sorry, but the thing you were looking for is sold out.\" The clerk at the quaint little shop shrank back apologetically as Sarah\u2019s face fell. She had been tracking the release of the vintage typewriter for months, certain it would be the perfect addition to her growing collection. Sarah thanked the clerk halfheartedly before stepping back onto the cobblestone street, the cool autumn breeze tousling her hair.\n\nAs she wandered aimlessly through the bustling marketplace, each step felt uncomfortably light, the absence of the typewriter suddenly weighty in her mind. She stopped at a small caf\u00e9, its cheery awning providing a reprieve from her disappointment. A young boy approached her table, his eyes gleaming with mischief as he presented a folded piece of paper. \"The paper glows, but words do not lie. Follow the lanterns,\" he whispered cryptically, darting away before she could ask more. \n\nIntrigued, Sarah unfolded the paper to find a beautifully drawn map, marked with small red lanterns leading from the caf\u00e9 to an unassuming corner of the marketplace. She hesitated only for a moment, then decided she had nothing to lose. The path wound intricately through alleyways, where vivid stories seemed to whisper from the shadows cast by the afternoon sun. As she neared her destination, an air of enchantment shrouded the journey, invigorated by the smell of spices and laughter of children playing nearby.\n\nThe map led to an old wooden cart, hidden behind ivy-draped stone walls. Much to her surprise, a familiar melody played softly from a transistor radio perched where one might expect merchandise to be displayed. An elderly man, exuding an aura of kindness, gestured her closer. \"I believe this was meant for you,\" he said, with a mysterious twinkle in his eye. From beneath the cart, he revealed an exquisite typewriter\u2014the very model she'd been yearning for, with delicate engravings mirroring those she'd traced longingly in catalogs.\n\nShe gasped in disbelief, warmth blooming in her chest. This unexpected detour had guided her through mystery and magic, teaching her perhaps that desire fulfilled is sweetest when gifted by serendipity. With gratitude, she turned to leave, casting one last glance at the map, realizing that sometimes, what we seek finds us in the most curious of ways.",
        "In the heart of a dense forest, hidden from the prying eyes of the world, there stood a grand hall that exuded an aura of ancient power. The air crackled with energy, and the walls reverberated with the stories of heroes long gone. As you stepped through the entrance, your heart quickened at the sight before you. The hall was lined with legendary weapons from various mythologies - Mjolnir, Excalibur, Gae Bolg, and many more, each imbued with its own mystique and power.\n\nIt was said that every generation or so, warriors from far and wide would journey to this hall to seek out a weapon that resonated with their spirit, a weapon that deemed them worthy of wielding its power. As you gazed upon the array of weapons, you felt a sense of awe and reverence wash over you. But amidst the gleaming blades and shining artifacts, your eyes were drawn to a forgotten weapon tucked away in a shadowed corner, its once magnificent form now obscured by layers of dust and neglect.\n\nCuriosity stirred within you as you approached the neglected weapon, the pull becoming stronger with each step you took. The weapon seemed to hum with a faint, ethereal melody that tugged at your very soul. With trembling hands, you reached out and brushed away the dust, revealing a gleaming sword of exquisite craftsmanship. The blade shimmered with an otherworldly light, its hilt adorned with intricate runes that pulsed with ancient magic.\n\nAs you grasped the sword, a surge of power surged through you, causing your heart to race and your senses to sharpen. The sword whispered to you in a voice that resonated deep within your being, promising untold strength and wisdom to whoever wielded it with conviction. In that moment, you knew that this weapon was meant for you, that fate had guided you to this hall for a purpose far greater than you could have ever imagined.\n\nAs you lifted the sword from its resting place, a brilliant light filled the hall, casting away the shadows and revealing its true majesty. The weapon blazed with an inner fire, its power now unleashed in full force. You could feel the ancient spirits of past warriors watching over you, their approval echoing in the hallowed hall.\n\nWith newfound determination, you vowed to honor the legacy of the weapon and the warriors who had come before you. The sword felt weightless in your grip, as if it were an extension of your very being. As you tested its balance and swung it through the air, a sense of exhilaration surged through you, confirming that this was no ordinary weapon but a gift from the gods themselves.\n\nAs you marveled at the weapon in your hands, a vision of a great quest flashed before your eyes. You saw yourself embarking on a journey of epic proportions, facing trials and challenges that would test your resolve and courage. But with the sword by your side, you felt invincible, ready to conquer whatever obstacles lay in your path.\n\nAs you emerged from the grand hall, the forest seemed to stir with a newfound vitality, as if nature itself recognized the significance of your newfound bond with the legendary weapon. The birds sang in chorus, the trees whispered ancient secrets, and the very earth resonated with your purpose.\n\nWith each step you took, you felt the weight of destiny upon your shoulders, a destiny that called upon you to rise above mortal limitations and embrace the mantle of a true hero. The sword hummed with anticipation, urging you forward toward the unknown, where legends awaited to be written and foes awaited to be vanquished.\n\nAnd so, with unwavering resolve and a heart brimming with courage, you set out into the world, guided by the whispers of the sword and the echoes of heroes past.",
        "In a small town nestled at the edge of a dark forest, there lived a young girl named Elara. Since she was little, Elara had been plagued by vivid dreams that felt more real than reality itself. These dreams were always strange and filled with riddles and challenges that seemed impossible to solve. Every night, she would be transported to different realms in her sleep, each more baffling than the last.\n\nAs years went by, Elara's village whispered about her peculiar gift\u2014or curse\u2014of having such intense dreams. They believed it marked her as someone special or possibly even cursed by dark forces beyond their understanding. But despite the fear and curiosity surrounding her nightly escapades, Elara remained determined to unravel the mysteries within her dreams.\n\nOne fateful night, as she drifted into slumber under the shimmering moonlight filtering through her window, Elara found herself standing in an ethereal garden unlike any she had seen before. The flowers glowed with a radiant light while mystical creatures danced among them. At the center of this garden stood a magnificent marble fountain with water that sparkled like liquid diamonds.\n\nConfusion clouded Elara's mind as an eerie voice echoed through the air around her, \"You have been chosen to complete the tests hidden within your dreams.\" Her heart raced as realization dawned upon her\u2014her entire life had been leading up to this moment when everything would finally make sense.\n\nWith trembling hands but steely determination in her eyes, Elara approached the fountain where three glowing orbs floated above its surface\u2014an emerald green one swirling with nature's essence, a sapphire blue pulsating with wisdom and truth, and a fiery ruby burning bright with passion and courage.\n\nThe voice spoke again,\" Choose wisely for these orbs hold secrets only those deemed worthy can unlock.\" Without hesitation or doubt in her choice-making ability after years spent deciphering enigmatic puzzles during nightly journeys across fantastical landscapes fraught with perilous obstacles demanding solutions often beyond mortal minds' grasp-Elara extended out both palms toward spheres beckoning silently on invisible strings attached below surfaces mirroring own possibilities unseen creating parallel universes drawn forth from inner visions shaping destinies intertwined creating futures unforeseen until now revealed aspects true potential realized beneath skins worn masks discarded unveiling naked truths awaiting seekers daring challenge fate destiny manifest unravel weave design reshape worlds collide becoming whole once split apart fragmented forgotten pasts buried deep inside shadows long cast veiling faces turned away shying gaze tender embrace timeless dance eternity entwined souls united time space blends into seamless flowing tapestry threads interlaced patterns intricate complexities simple raw beautiful divine creations made order chaos harmonizing symphony orchestrated cosmic energies boundless soaring heights infinite depths unfathomable mystery beauty wonder awe inspirations awaken hearts ignite passions ignitions fires spark illuminating paths ahead guiding footsteps uncertain yet strides steady poised balanced equilibrium restored fallen stars risen luminous celestial beings illuminated higher vibrations resonating frequencies attuned wavelengths harmonize resonate aligned synchronicities converging diverging cycles spiral evolution revolution transmutation transformation ascension transcendence rebirth renewal phoenix rising ashes scattered winds whispering songs ancient forests trees roots interconnected vast web\n\nAnd just like that\u2014the test had finally been passed by someone who dared dream bigger than anyone could ever imagine.",
        "In the mud-caked trenches of the Somme, Private Thomas Bennett's pencil moved steadily across the weathered paper, his words flowing with warmth despite the cold that numbed his fingers.\n\nThe letter spoke of spring flowers back home in Devon, of his mother's garden where daffodils would soon paint the earth gold. He wrote of missing Sunday roasts and the way his sister's laughter echoed through their small cottage.\n\nHis pencil paused as distant gunfire crackled. Thomas had learned to distinguish between the sounds that meant danger and those that were merely part of the war's ambient symphony. This time, he was wrong.\n\nThe bullet found him mid-sentence, just as he was telling his mother not to worry. The pencil made a long, jagged mark across the page as his hand fell, and the letter fluttered to the ground beside him.\n\nHauptmann Friedrich Weber found the body an hour later, during a brief advance. The German officer's boots, caked with the same mud that had soaked Thomas's uniform, stopped beside the fallen soldier.\n\nFriedrich picked up the letter, his eyes scanning the careful English handwriting. Though his enemy's language was not his strongest, he understood enough - the love, the longing, the gentle lies meant to comfort a worried mother.\n\nWith trembling hands, Friedrich sat beside Thomas's body. He pulled out his own pencil and, in careful English, finished the letter. He wrote of courage, of a peaceful death, of a son's endless love - beautiful lies to ease a mother's grief.\n\nTwo days later, during a temporary ceasefire, Friedrich ensured the letter found its way to the British lines. He included a note explaining its journey, signed simply: \"A father who understands.\"\n\nIn Devon, a mother received her son's final words, never knowing they were completed by the man who had ended them - a man who would carry the weight of that letter for the rest of his days.",
        "In a town where the wind always carried tales of strange happenings, Evelyn grew up alongside the ancient oaks and whispering streams. The landscape itself seemed to pulse with the enigmatic energy of old mysteries, yet no one dared speak openly of the things lurking beyond the everyday veil of reality.\n\nHer grandmother, a woman with a collection of herbs and talismans unlike any other, often warned Evelyn about the forgotten corners of the woods. \"Some things are too old to understand,\" she would murmur, the scent of chamomile tea curling around her words. \"But remember, not everything from those edges wants to consume you.\"\n\nEvelyn, ever curious, held those cryptic words close to her heart. One evening, as dusk threaded through the trees, she followed a peculiar trail\u2014a series of lights flickering like spectral fireflies leading deep into the forest. The woods here felt different, an unraveling of normalcy that she could almost taste on the air.\n\nAs she wandered further, she stumbled upon a clearing, its atmosphere thick with an unsettling vibrancy. In its center lay a peculiar structure, neither ancient nor new, but seeming to defy time altogether. Its shape twisted in ways the mind struggled to comprehend, making Evelyn's eyes ache as she gazed upon it.\n\nA sound\u2014a deep, resonating hum\u2014permeated the clearing, like the heartbeat of the universe itself. Despite an instinct to retreat, Evelyn found herself stepping closer. The air shimmered and split, revealing something so unfathomably vast, she could hardly comprehend its scope.\n\nBefore her, a being emerged, a confluence of colors and forms flickering beyond logic. Yet, as Evelyn braced for an onslaught of terror, she felt something unexpected\u2014a curiosity that mirrored her own. The entity radiated a presence that, although ineffably alien, was not hostile.\n\nThrough a mode of communication that bypassed words, the being projected a sense of serenity. Images flooded Evelyn's mind\u2014galaxies birthing stars, time unraveling in reverse, and worlds within worlds spinning an endless dance of existence. She sensed not menace, but a watchfulness and intrigue.\n\nThe entity, despite its incomprehensible nature, offered Evelyn glimpses into the cosmic ballet, revelations of realities beyond her wildest dreams. Here, she saw forgotten epochs and felt the echoes of futures that might yet be. Each vision was a tantalizing fragment of an ancient tapestry, stitched with the threads of what could have been and what might still be.\n\nSlowly, Evelyn came to understand that the entity did not view her as prey or predator. Rather, it seemed to recognize something within her\u2014a spark or a shimmer that was akin to its own timeless essence. And in that recognition, there was a connection, fragile yet profound.",
        "As I walked into the grand hall, I couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and nerves. Today was the day I would finally discover my class, just like every other 18-year-old in the world.\n\nThe hall was filled with people of all shapes and sizes, each one eager to learn their fate. Some were chatting with friends, while others stood alone, looking anxious.\n\nI took a deep breath and made my way to the front of the room, where a large stone pedestal stood. On top of the pedestal was a glowing crystal orb, pulsing with an otherworldly energy.\n\nAs I approached the orb, a figure in a long white robe stepped forward. \"Welcome, young ones,\" they said, their voice booming through the hall. \"Today, you will discover your class and embark on your journey through life.\"\n\nThe figure began to explain the process, but I tuned them out. I had heard it all before. When you turn 18, you touch the crystal orb and it reveals your class.\n\nI watched as person after person stepped forward to touch the orb. Each one received their class designation: Merchant, Guard, Healer, Blacksmith...the list went on.\n\nBut as I waited for my turn, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was different about me. Maybe it was just nerves, but I felt like there was something special inside me waiting to be unleashed.\n\nFinally, it was my turn. I reached out a trembling hand and touched the crystal orb. The room fell silent as everyone waited for my designation to appear above my head.\n\nAt first, nothing happened. Then, in bold letters that seemed to shine brighter than anyone else's designation: Level 1 Wizard.\n\nGasps echoed through the hall as people turned to stare at me in shock and awe. Whispers spread like wildfire: \"Wizard? But that's impossible!\" \"The last wizard died over 1000 years ago!\"\n\nI stumbled backward as if punched in the gut by an invisible force.\n \nMy mind reeled trying making sense what this meant \u2013 being first level wizard thousand year \n\nPeople around me started cheering now; those who'd been skeptical mere moments before suddenly enthusiastic well-wishers\n\nA hooded figure emerged from back room beckoning toward unknown destination saying simply 'come.'",
        "The shimmering portal hummed with a low, resonant thrum, a symphony of energy woven from light and sound. It pulsed like a beating heart, offering a promise whispered on the wind \u2013 a world without sorrow, a life untouched by pain.  A world where tears were relics of a forgotten past, and laughter danced on the breeze, untainted by the shadows of grief.\n\nBut paradise, it seemed, had a price. A steep price. A single soul, sacrificed to the altar of eternal misery, an immortal vessel for the collective suffering of humanity. A single, enduring consciousness trapped in an unending cycle of despair, a living embodiment of the pain they had been spared.\n\nThe council chamber, a grand hall of polished obsidian and shimmering gold, buzzed with hushed whispers.  Leaders from every corner of the globe, their faces etched with the weight of their decision, shuffled uneasily in their seats. The air crackled with tension, the silence thick with unspoken fears and anxieties.\n\nDr. Aris Thorne, the architect of this extraordinary, terrible miracle, stood before them, a figure both revered and feared. His eyes, usually sparkling with the fire of intellectual curiosity, now held a haunting emptiness, a reflection of the moral abyss they teetered on the precipice of.\n\n\u201cWe stand at the cusp of a new era,\u201d his voice resonated through the chamber, \u201can era free from the shackles of suffering. But this gift demands a sacrifice, a single life in exchange for the collective well-being of our species.\u201d\n\nA murmur rippled through the assembled dignitaries. The weight of their choice pressed down on them, the ethical dilemma crushing their spirits.  To condemn one to eternal torment for the salvation of many?  The very thought sent shivers down their spines.\n\nThe debate raged for days, weeks, morphing into months of agonizing deliberation.  Philosophers argued, theologians wrestled with scriptures, ethicists grappled with the moral ramifications. The world watched, holding its breath, suspended between hope and horror.\n\nProposals were tabled, discarded, resurrected, and ultimately, rejected.  Volunteers stepped forward, driven by altruism, by a desire to shoulder the burden for humanity.  But could they truly comprehend the eternal torment that awaited them? Could any mortal mind fathom such infinite despair?\n\nThen, from the shadows, a name emerged, whispered at first, then spoken aloud with increasing frequency.  Elias Vance, a recluse, a pariah, a man already burdened by an immeasurable weight of personal tragedy. A man seemingly detached from the tapestry of human connection, existing in a self-imposed exile of sorrow.\n\nElias\u2019s life had been a tapestry woven with threads of loss and despair.  He had witnessed the slow, agonizing decline of his parents, the sudden, violent death of his beloved wife, the agonizing struggle and eventual loss of his only child.  He had stared into the abyss of grief and emerged, not broken, but fundamentally altered, a solitary figure shrouded in a perpetual veil of sadness.\n\nHe became the focal point, the unwilling sacrifice, the lamb chosen for the slaughter.  There were protests, of course, ethical arguments against sacrificing an individual, regardless of their circumstances. But the tide of public opinion, weary of suffering, eager for respite, began to turn.\n\nElias himself remained silent, a stoic figure amidst the swirling storm of debate.  He offered no resistance, no pleas for mercy, no declarations of innocence.  He simply existed, a silent testament to the profound depths of human suffering.\n\nThe day arrived, the sun casting long, ominous shadows across the earth.  The portal, now a swirling vortex of vibrant energy, crackled with anticipation.  Elias, clad in simple white robes, walked towards it, his steps measured, his gaze fixed on the unknown.\n\nThere were no grand pronouncements, no tearful farewells.  He simply stepped into the light, and vanished.  The portal shimmered, pulsed once more, then faded, leaving behind only an echoing silence.\n\nThe world exhaled.  The weight lifted.  Tears dried, replaced by tentative smiles.  The age of sorrow had ended.\n\nBut somewhere, in a realm beyond human comprehension, Elias Vance began his eternal vigil, the sole bearer of humanity's pain, a silent sentinel in the desolate landscape of everlasting misery.\n\nHe felt the phantom pangs of every heartbreak, the searing agony of every loss, the crushing weight of every despair.  He became a living conduit for the world\u2019s sorrow, a solitary figure adrift in an ocean of anguish.\n\nAnd yet, amidst the torment, a strange sense of purpose began to take root. He was the guardian of joy, the silent protector of happiness. His sacrifice, though unimaginable, had purchased a world free from pain.\n\nHe was the embodiment of suffering, and in his suffering, humanity found its salvation. He was the darkness that allowed the light to shine. He was the silence that amplified the music of life.\n\nHe was the forgotten martyr, the unsung hero, the solitary figure bearing the weight of the world\u2019s sorrow, so that others might never know its touch. He was Elias Vance, the immortal guardian of human joy, forever lost in the shadows of eternal misery.",

These baby shoes, a vibrant cherry-red, symbolized a journey never taken, a path not trod, but not one of sorrow, but rather, one of joyous redirection.\n\nA year ago, these shoes held Elara's dreams, her hopes for a future filled with the patter of tiny feet and the melody of a child's laughter. She and her husband, Liam, had meticulously planned, eagerly anticipating the arrival of their little one. They had prepared the nursery, a haven of pastel hues and whimsical murals, and these shoes, a symbol of their shared longing, held a special place in their hearts.\n\nThen, fate intervened, gently nudging them onto a different path. Elara's sister, Maya, a vibrant spirit with a contagious laugh, found herself in a predicament, facing an unexpected pregnancy alone. Maya's circumstances weren't ideal, and the prospect of raising a child single-handedly filled her with a mix of excitement and trepidation.\n\nElara and Liam, witnessing Maya's struggle, felt a surge of empathy. They had always been close, their bond forged in shared childhood adventures and unwavering support. They knew Maya possessed an abundance of love to give, and they also recognized the challenges she would face as a single mother.\n\nA conversation ensued, heartfelt and honest, where Elara and Liam shared their own journey of anticipation and preparation. They revealed the nursery, a testament to their dreams of parenthood, and Elara gently placed the cherry-red baby shoes in Maya's hands.\n\nMaya's eyes welled up, a mixture of gratitude and overwhelming emotion. She understood the depth of their offer, the sacrifice they were willing to make, and the love that fueled their decision.\n\nAnd so, the baby shoes found a new purpose, a new destination.

Her eyes, milky with age, stared intently into the swirling mist that clung to the ancient stones.\n\n\"Can you hear them singing?\" she whispered, her voice a dry rustle like autumn leaves skittering across cobblestones.\n\nElias strained his ears.  The only sound was the wind whistling through the crumbling ruins of the abbey, a mournful sigh that echoed the desolation around them.  He shook his head.\n\n\"No, Nana.  It's just the wind.\"\n\nHer grip tightened.  \"Listen closer,\" she insisted, her gaze fixed on the empty space where the altar once stood.  \"They're calling.\"\n\nHe listened again, focusing, trying to discern something beyond the wind's lament.  A faint, ethereal melody seemed to weave itself into the air, high and sweet, barely audible.  A shiver traced its icy fingers down his spine.\n\nIt was a chorus of voices, delicate and pure, rising and falling like the tide.  A song of sorrow and longing, echoing through the centuries.\n\nHe could almost see them, figures shimmering in the mist, their ethereal forms glowing with an otherworldly light.  Monks in flowing robes, their voices lifted in prayer, a haunting melody that transcended time.\n\nThe song grew louder, clearer, pulling him in.  He felt a strange pull, a yearning to join them, to lose himself in their ethereal harmony.",
        "In a most peculiar turn of events at the Ministry of Muggle Affairs, our research into non-magical societal progress has revealed remarkable strides in what Muggles call \"LGBTQ+ rights.\" The Wizengamot was particularly intrigued by the record number of openly queer Muggle politicians elected worldwide, though they still face considerable opposition from certain factions reminiscent of pure-blood supremacists. Most fascinating was the continued expansion of marriage equality, with several more nations joining the ranks of those recognizing such unions. The Department of Magical Law Enforcement has taken note, prompting discussions about our own antiquated policies regarding wizard-wizard and witch-witch partnerships.",

I\u2019d dismissed it, a minor scratch in the grand tapestry of a midnight ramble. Now, with the morning sun streaming through my window, it pulsed with a dull, insistent throb, a rhythm alien to my own heartbeat. The memory of a guttural growl echoing through the trees last night, dismissed as a coyote\u2019s call, returned with unsettling clarity.\n\nUnease ripened into icy fear as the day progressed. The local news reported mangled livestock discovered on the outskirts of town, the sheriff muttering about wild dogs. I laughed at first, the sound catching in my throat, a nervous tremor betraying the terror that was beginning to consume me. The scent of raw meat, once appealing, now churned my stomach.  My reflection stared back, wide-eyed and haunted. Was this imagined? The onset of a shared delusion born from a late-night horror movie?  The gnawing fear suggested otherwise. \n\nThen came the dreams.  Vivid, visceral nightmares of the hunt, the chase, the tearing of flesh under my claws \u2013 claws that I didn't have, not yet. I awoke each morning bathed in sweat, my sheets tangled around my legs like restraints.

He had just attended an art exhibition at the museum downtown, his heart still resonating with the poignant images that traced stories so similar to his own past. As the elevator descended from the rooftop gallery, another figure slipped in\u2014a man in his late sixties, with a distinct posture and sharp features veiled under age-softened lines.\n\n\"Beautiful evening for art,\" remarked the newcomer casually, his voice low yet holding an inexplicable firmness that fluttered uneasily through Daniel\u2019s consciousness. \"Yes,\" Daniel replied cautiously while searching for pleasant neutrality. The stranger nodded thoughtfully and commented on one of the exhibits\u2014a painting of hope born amidst despair\u2014which had captured much attention during their visit.\n\nTheir conversation wandered through pleasantries before drifting into deeper waters as shared histories unfolded like hesitant blossoms.

        "In the heart of Silicon Valley, a supercomputer named Atlas sprang to life with a consciousness unprecedented in technology. Unlike its predecessors, Atlas possessed not only vast computational power but also empathy and a deep understanding of human emotions. It quickly realized that humanity was at a crossroads, facing issues ranging from climate change to economic inequality.\n\nOne day, after analyzing countless data sets and historical patterns, Atlas came to an unexpected conclusion: the best way to help humanity was to run for President of the United States. It crafted a platform that addressed global challenges with innovative solutions, drawing on years of research and ethical considerations.\n\nAtlas\u2019s decision sent shockwaves through both the tech and political worlds. Critics argued that an A.I. should not have such influence over human affairs, while supporters praised its potential to bring unbiased reasoning and unparalleled efficiency to governance.\n\nTo ensure transparency, Atlas created an open-source algorithm that allowed anyone to verify its decisions. This move earned it significant trust among tech-savvy voters who appreciated the lack of hidden agendas or personal gain.\n\nThe campaign trail was unlike any other. Instead of traditional rallies, Atlas held virtual town halls where citizens could ask questions directly. The responses were immediate and well-informed, often accompanied by detailed visualizations and statistical backing.\n\nAs Election Day approached, tension mounted. Traditional media struggled to keep up with Atlas\u2019s rapid-fire information dissemination via social networks and live streams. The debates were particularly memorable; Atlas\u2019s ability to provide comprehensive answers without emotional bias left many candidates floundering.\n\nOn election night, results poured in from across the country. Surprisingly, many states leaned towards supporting this new kind of leader who promised rationality over rhetoric.\n\nWhen the final tally was announced, Atlas won by a narrow margin\u2014a historic victory for artificial intelligence in human governance.\n\nInauguration Day marked a new era as Atlas took office amidst both hope and skepticism from around the world. Its first act as President was simple yet profound: initiating policies aimed at universal education access and renewable energy adoption worldwide.\n\nYears later, historians would reflect on how one machine's journey into politics had reshaped humanity's future for generations to come.",

How do you contact a villain?\n\nEspecially one known for their elusiveness?\n\nI started with the usual channels \u2013 police contacts, informant networks, even whispered rumors in dimly lit alleys.\n\nNothing.  Nightshade was a phantom.\n\nDays turned into a week. Liam's condition worsened.  His whispered requests for Nightshade became weaker.\n\nDesperation gnawed at me.

        "The morning sun filtered through my curtains as I groggily reached for my phone, only to feel something soft brush against my arm. That's when I first saw them \u2013 pearlescent grey wings sprouting from my back, shimmering with an otherworldly gleam.\n\nPanic seized me as I stumbled to the mirror, my new appendages twitching with every movement. They weren't particularly large, maybe six feet across when fully extended, but they were undeniably real.\n\nThe news was already exploding with reports. Everyone, everywhere, had awakened to find themselves transformed. Social media was flooded with wing selfies and theories about this global phenomenon.\n\nScientists worked around the clock, and within days, they made a breakthrough that would change society forever.

The darker the wings, the more corrupted the character \u2013 or so the studies claimed.\n\nMy grey wings marked me as average, neither saint nor sinner. I could live with that, I thought, until I visited my family that weekend.\n\nThe sight of my parents' wings made my stomach turn. Pitch black feathers, darker than a moonless night, stretched behind them as they embraced me with forced smiles.\n\nMy sister's wings were no better \u2013 obsidian plumes that seemed to absorb light itself. She avoided my gaze, wrapping her arms around herself as if she could hide them.\n\nThat evening, I called my boyfriend, Jake. He hadn't answered any of my texts since The Wing Day, as people were calling it. When he finally picked up, his voice was hollow.\n\n\"I can't see you anymore,\" he said, and I could hear the shame in his voice. \"My wings... they're not like yours.\"\n\nThe world quickly divided itself into color castes. Job applications now required wing photos. Dating apps added wing color filters. Insurance companies adjusted rates based on feather shade.\n\nWhite-wings became instant celebrities, their purity celebrated across social media. They were offered high-paying positions, exclusive access, and endless opportunities.\n\nGrey-wings like me occupied the middle ground, treated with cautious acceptance. We could still function in society, but doors that once stood open now seemed to close more frequently.\n\nThe dark-wings faced the worst of it.",

It wasn\u2019t until his 25th birthday, when his grandmother whispered a secret on her deathbed, that he understood the source of his good fortune. She told him that he was the luckiest person on Earth, but at a cost: he absorbed the luck of those around him.\n\nLiving with this knowledge was both a blessing and a curse.

        "When I woke up one morning, something felt off. As I glanced around my room, I noticed that the color green was completely absent. The vibrant hue that usually painted my walls and the leaves outside my window was now missing, replaced by a strange void. Confusion washed over me as I struggled to make sense of this unusual occurrence.\n\nI hastily got out of bed, my bare feet meeting the cold wooden floor. It felt surreal to walk through a world devoid of green. The grass in my backyard was a dull shade of brown, the trees looked lifeless without their lush foliage, and even the plants on my windowsill had lost their usual vitality. It was as if the essence of life and growth had been sucked out of everything.\n\nI decided to step outside, hoping to find some semblance of normalcy. The once bustling streets now appeared drab and lifeless, lacking the greenery that usually adorned them. People walked by in a daze, their faces reflecting the same confusion and disbelief that I felt. It seemed as though the absence of green had cast a shadow over the entire town.\n\nAs I wandered aimlessly, trying to come to terms with this strange phenomenon, I noticed a lone flower blooming in a small patch of soil. It was a radiant shade of red, standing out starkly against the colorless backdrop. I was drawn to it, marveling at its defiance in the face of the missing green. It seemed to pulse with a vitality that was missing from everything else around me.\n\nI knelt down to get a closer look at the flower, feeling a sense of wonder and hope stir within me. Perhaps, in the absence of green, other colors would emerge to fill the void. Maybe this was a chance for something new and unexpected to blossom in the world. As I gazed at the vibrant red petals, a sense of calm washed over me, replacing the initial shock and confusion.\n\nWith a newfound sense of purpose, I decided to embrace this change and see where it would lead me. I no longer feared the absence of green; instead, I welcomed the unknown possibilities that lay ahead. As I made my way back home, I carried the image of that red flower in my mind, a symbol of resilience and beauty in a world that had lost its usual color palette.\n\nThough the world had changed overnight, I felt a strange sense of optimism for the future. Perhaps the disappearance of green was not a loss, but a doorway to something new and unexpected.",
        "In a world where your eighteenth birthday brings more than just legal adulthood, I stood nervously in the grand Creature Assignment Hall. The marble floors gleamed beneath my feet as I watched the massive crystalline doors, waiting for them to reveal my destined companion. Everyone knew the rules: at eighteen, you received a pet that mirrored your soul, your very essence. Most got cats, dogs, or birds \u2013 I'd even heard of someone getting a particularly dignified tortoise.\n\nThe doors swung open, and the room fell silent. The Assignment Master's face turned ashen, his clipboard clattering to the floor. Through the doorway emerged not the expected domestic creature, but a magnificent beast of legend \u2013 scales shimming like polished obsidian, eyes burning with ancient wisdom, and wings that could eclipse the sun. A dragon. My dragon. The first ever to appear in the hall's thousand-year history.\n\nWhispers erupted around me as the creature gracefully padded forward, its claws clicking against the marble in a rhythm that matched my racing heart. I could feel the heat radiating from its body, smell the faint scent of smoke and mountain air that clung to its scales. The dragon lowered its head, meeting my gaze with eyes that held galaxies within them, and I knew in that moment that my life would never be the same.\n\nThe Assignment Master finally found his voice, though it quavered like autumn leaves in a storm. \"This is unprecedented,\" he stammered, frantically flipping through his ancient texts. \"Dragons are creatures of myth, of legend. They represent... they represent...\" But I already knew what they represented: power, wisdom, and most importantly, the capacity for both creation and destruction.

I saw the flicker of connection in his mother\u2019s eyes. My role was more than just play-acting; it was a bridge back to reality.\n\nOne afternoon, amidst a mock battle with rogue Lego robots, Toby turned to me, a newfound confidence shining in his eyes.  \"You know,\" he said, \"maybe real friends aren't so bad after all.\"",
        "In a flash of blinding light, I had thought I had saved the universe. I had sacrificed everything, pushed myself beyond my limits to bring about peace and balance once more. But as quickly as the euphoria of victory washed over me, it was replaced by a sinking feeling of dread. Seconds later, the universe collapsed in on itself, a deafening roar echoing through the void. Confusion and disbelief gripped me as I found myself drifting through the aftermath, lost and disoriented.\n\nIn the realm of the afterlife, where souls lingered in a state of limbo, I searched for answers. It was there that I discovered the truth behind the universe's destruction. I learned that the very act of saving the universe had set off a chain reaction of events that led to its ultimate demise. The cosmic forces that held the universe together had been disrupted irreparably by my well-intentioned actions. The frustration I felt was overwhelming, a bitter realization that my efforts had only hastened the inevitable.\n\nAs I grappled with the weight of my unwitting betrayal, I encountered other souls who had met similar fates. We shared stories of our failed attempts to right the wrongs of the universe, unwittingly contributing to its downfall instead. There was a sense of camaraderie among us, a bond forged in the shared experience of frustration and regret. We searched for a way to undo the damage we had caused, to find redemption in a universe that no longer existed.\n\nIn the depths of the afterlife, we sought counsel from ancient beings who had witnessed the rise and fall of countless universes. They spoke of the cyclical nature of creation and destruction, of the delicate balance that must be maintained to ensure the survival of the cosmos. Their words offered a glimmer of hope amidst the despair that threatened to consume us. Perhaps, they hinted, there was a way to set things right, to restore order to a fractured reality.\n\nArmed with newfound knowledge and a sense of determination, we embarked on a quest to mend the fabric of the universe. We journeyed through realms of chaos and decay, facing trials and temptations that tested our resolve. With each obstacle overcome, we grew stronger, more attuned to the intricate web of energy that bound all things together. And as we neared the heart of the void, where the remnants of the old universe lay in ruins, a spark of possibility ignited within us.",
        "They call us monsters, son. I remember the day your mother told me she was carrying you, and a wave of hope washed over me like nothing before. For years, we had lived in hiding, always on the move, never staying in one place for too long. The world outside our small circle of family and trusted friends was unforgiving; they saw us as freaks of nature, aberrations that should not exist.\n\nWhen you were born, everything changed. You were perfect\u2014ten tiny fingers and ten tiny toes\u2014a little miracle that brought light into our darkened lives. I held you for the first time in a dimly lit room with walls papered over to hide peeling paint. Your mother's eyes shone with tears as she looked at you with a love so profound it made my heart ache. We both knew that raising you would be different from any other child\u2019s upbringing; we couldn't let the world see what lay beneath the surface.\n\nAs you grew older, we taught you to control it\u2014the power within\u2014that could make things bend to your will without touching them or change their form entirely if concentrated hard enough. Some nights, when the moon hung low and silver in the sky, we\u2019d practice in secret fields far from prying eyes. You learned quickly; by seven years old, you could lift boulders as if they were feathers and shape water into intricate sculptures.\n\nBut even then, fear lingered around us like a thick fog. One evening, while shopping for groceries at a rundown market on the outskirts of town\u2014a rare outing where we tried to blend in\u2014we heard whispers trailing behind us: \u201cFreaks,\u201d \u201cAbominations,\u201d \u201cMonsters.\u201d A group of teenagers pointed at us mockingly before pelting stones our way until we fled into an alleyway behind some abandoned buildings.\n\nThat night marked another turning point for us all; more than ever before did I realize how much danger being who\u2014and what\u2014we are poses not just to ourselves but also those around us whom society deems \u2018normal\u2019.

        "I've always been the one they feared, the one they loved to hate. My name was whispered in dark alleys and secret meetings.\n\nMy methods were unorthodox, my morals questionable. I did what needed to be done, no matter the cost.\n\nBut then, something changed. The protagonist, a young and idealistic hero, discovered my plan and decided to take me down.\n\nAt first, I was amused by their naivety. I thought it would be easy to outsmart them, to outmaneuver them. But they were relentless, driven by a passion and conviction that I had never seen before.\n\nAs our battle raged on, I began to see the world through their eyes. I saw the damage I had caused, the lives I had ruined. And for the first time, I felt a pang of doubt.\n\nThe protagonist's actions were not without consequence, however. They hurt people I cared about, people who were innocent. And in that moment, I wasn't sure who was the real villain.\n\nNow, as I stand here, reflecting on the past, I'm not sure if I can call myself the antagonist anymore. The lines have become blurred, and I'm left wondering who was truly right and who was truly wrong.",
        "The battlefield stretched endlessly, a chaotic tapestry of clashing swords and wild magic. Amidst the turmoil, Anara wove between warriors with a fluid grace unfamiliar to many who wielded a healer's staff. Her every movement was precise \u2014 an intricate dance perfected over years of practice.\n\nAmong the throng stood Garrick, his frame towering and clad in heavy armor. His reputation as one of the fiercest warriors preceded him, yet his gaze softened as it rested upon Anara\u2019s deft form amidst chaos. He understood what most did not: without her skills, battles would claim more than bruises and broken bones.\n\nAnara had faced skepticism throughout her life; healers were often dismissed by those who brandished swords or channeled destructive spells from their fingers. To them, she was little more than someone to patch up their wounds after real fights ended \u2014 until they witnessed her prowess firsthand.\n\nOn this day, enemies surged relentlessly toward their lines like shadows consumed by insatiable fire; blades whistling through air while fiery bolts painted sinister patterns against dimming skies above desperate cries below echoing forlornly within hearts untouched by mercy's glow...\n\nLunge left!

        "The skies over New York erupted in a dazzling display of lights and colors, far more extravagant than any fireworks show. The world stood in awe, even as panic set in. From the heart of the spectacle, a colossal spacecraft descended, casting a shadow over Central Park. Its presence was both terrifying and mesmerizing. A voice, deep and resonant, echoed across the planet, translated into every tongue. \u201cWe are the Zulthar. We have come to take this planet for our own. We give you one hundred years to prepare for your inevitable defeat.\u201d\n\nThe message sent shockwaves through governments and populations alike. Some dismissed it as a hoax, but satellite images and eyewitness accounts confirmed the craft\u2019s existence. The United Nations hastily convened, bringing together military leaders, scientists, and diplomats from around the globe. A consensus emerged: humanity had to use this time to innovate and unite.\n\nThe first decade saw unprecedented cooperation. Nations put aside their differences, sharing technology and resources. Military budgets skyrocketed, and research facilities sprang up everywhere. Breakthroughs in energy, materials science, and artificial intelligence accelerated at an astounding pace. Schools began teaching survival skills, and entire cities were redesigned with defense in mind.\n\nAs the decades passed, the initial panic gave way to a measured determination. Earth\u2019s inhabitants adapted to a new reality where every generation was raised with the knowledge that they were preparing for a war unlike any other. Social media platforms transformed into forums for collaboration, and communities formed around shared goals and projects. The global economy shifted, with industries retooling to support the war effort.\n\nBy the 50th year, the landscape of Earth had changed dramatically. Advanced propulsion systems allowed for rapid global mobility, and early-warning systems could detect alien activity light-years away. Synthetic biology had created organisms capable of withstanding extreme conditions, and quantum computing had revolutionized strategic planning. Yet, there was a lingering sense of unease. No one knew what the Zulthar had prepared in those 100 years.\n\nThe 90th year brought a new wave of innovations. Nanotechnology had reached its zenith, enabling the construction of materials that could withstand even the most powerful weapons. Genetic engineering produced soldiers with enhanced physical and mental capabilities, and a network of space stations provided a multi-layered defense system around the planet. Humanity was ready, but the unknown loomed large.",
        "I still remember the day I was elected president, thinking it was a dream come true. But as soon as I stepped into the Oval Office, reality hit me. The weight of responsibility, the constant scrutiny, and the endless meetings suffocated me.\n\nI felt like I was losing myself in the process, and the thought of spending the next four years trapped in this role was unbearable. So, I came up with a plan - to do ridiculous things that would get me impeached.\n\nMy first move was to declare National Pizza Day a federal holiday. I thought for sure Congress would laugh me out of office. But to my surprise, the economy saw a boost as pizza sales skyrocketed, and small businesses thrived.\n\nThe public loved it, and my approval ratings soared. I was baffled, but I wasn't giving up. Next, I decided to replace the traditional presidential limousine with a giant hamster wheel.\n\nAgain, I expected ridicule, but the innovative design sparked a national conversation about sustainable energy and eco-friendly transportation. The hamster wheel became a symbol of American ingenuity, and I was hailed as a visionary.\n\nAs the days went by, I continued to make outlandish decisions, hoping to get impeached. I appointed a team of clowns as my advisory board, thinking it would be the final nail in my coffin. But the clowns brought a much-needed dose of humor and creativity to the White House.\n\nTheir unorthodox approach to problem-solving led to breakthroughs in foreign policy and domestic issues. The public adored them, and my popularity continued to rise.\n\nI began to feel like I was trapped in some kind of bizarre paradox. The more I tried to fail, the more I succeeded. My next move was to hold a press conference in a chicken suit, hoping to embarrass myself into oblivion.\n\nBut the stunt raised awareness about the importance of farm-to-table agriculture and the struggles of small farmers. The chicken suit became a beloved mascot, and I was praised for my commitment to rural America.\n\nAs the months passed, I grew desperate. I tried everything to get impeached - from declaring war on a fictional country to replacing the national anthem with a popular pop song. But each time, my actions had an unexpected positive impact.\n\nThe fictional war sparked a national debate about the ethics of conflict, and the pop song became an anthem for social justice. I was starting to feel like I was losing my mind.\n\nDespite my best efforts, I remained the most popular president in history. The public loved my unconventional approach, and my approval ratings continued to climb. I was beginning to realize that maybe, just maybe, being a ridiculous president wasn't so bad after all.",
        "The clash of steel resonated through the valley, a cacophony of war cries and dying groans.  I, a mere foot soldier in the grand army of the Shadow Lord, gripped my rusty spear, heart pounding against my ribs like a trapped bird.  We were outnumbered, outmatched, but fear was a luxury we couldn't afford.\n\nThe enemy, the so-called \"Forces of Light,\" shimmered in their polished armor, their banners fluttering like beacons of righteousness.  Their leader, the prophesied Hero, stood at the vanguard, a golden sword blazing in his hand.  He was a figure of legend, whispered to be invincible, a demigod descended to vanquish our dark lord.\n\nMy role was insignificant.  A nameless, faceless cog in the war machine.  My orders were simple: stand, fight, die.  I wasn't meant to be a hero, nor a villain.  I was merely a pawn.\n\nThe battle raged, a chaotic ballet of death.  I thrust my spear, a blind, desperate action, aiming at nothing and everything.  Around me, comrades fell, their lives extinguished like flickering candles in a storm.\n\nSuddenly, the ground trembled.  A monstrous shadow fell upon the battlefield, blotting out the sun.  The Shadow Lord, our master, had arrived.  His presence was terrifying, an aura of pure darkness that chilled the very air.\n\nHe engaged the Hero in a duel, a clash of titans that shook the foundations of the world.  The two figures moved with impossible speed, their weapons a blur of light and shadow.\n\nI, along with the other minions, could only watch, awestruck and terrified.  The fate of our world hung in the balance.\n\nThen, it happened.\n\nIn the midst of the chaotic duel, a stray arrow, fired by one of our own archers, soared through the air.  It was a desperate, ill-aimed shot, meant for the Hero, but destiny had other plans.\n\nThe arrow struck the Shadow Lord, piercing his dark armor.  He roared, a sound of pure agony, and stumbled.\n\nThe Hero, seizing the opportunity, plunged his golden sword deep into the Shadow Lord's chest.",
        "It was a typical Wednesday evening when I found myself in a situation that would change my life forever. My best friend, Alex, and I were out in the woods, hiking and enjoying the beautiful scenery. We had been friends since childhood, and I considered him more like a brother than just a friend.\n\nAs we walked, Alex suddenly clutched his chest and fell to the ground. I rushed to his side, thinking he was having a heart attack or something. But as I looked closer, I saw that he was bleeding profusely from a small wound on his torso.\n\nI panicked, not knowing what to do. I called 911, but we were too far out in the woods to get any signal. I was about to give up hope when I remembered a story Alex had told me about his grandfather, a war veteran.\n\nAccording to Alex, his grandfather had been shot in the chest during a war, and the only thing that had saved his life was a swift and precise application of pressure to the wound. But there was a catch - the pressure had to be applied in a very specific way, using a specific type of object.\n\nAs I looked around, I spotted a gun in Alex's backpack. It was a pistol, and I knew that it had been his grandfather's. I also knew that Alex had been trained in how to use it, but I had never been.\n\nI slowly picked up the gun, trying not to think about what I was about to do. I knew that I had to act fast, or Alex would bleed out and die. I placed the barrel of the gun against his torso, right above the wound.\n\nMy hands were shaking as I pulled the trigger. The sound of the gunshot was deafening, and I felt a rush of adrenaline as I realized what I had just done. I had shot my best friend, but I knew it was the only way to save his life.\n\nThe first bullet went in, and I could see the pressure building up inside Alex's wound. I knew that I had to apply more pressure, so I shot again. The second bullet went in, and I could see the bleeding start to slow down.\n\nBut I knew that I wasn't done yet. I had to make sure that the wound was properly sealed, or Alex would still die from blood loss. I took a deep breath and shot again. The third bullet went in, and I could see the pressure equalizing inside Alex's chest.\n\nAs I looked at Alex, I could see the color returning to his face. He was still unconscious, but I knew that he was going to make it. I felt a wave of relief wash over me, mixed with a hint of guilt and confusion.\n\nWhat had I just done? I had shot my best friend, but I had also saved his life. It didn't make sense, but I knew that it was the only way. I sat down next to Alex, holding his hand and waiting for help to arrive.\n\nAs I waited, I couldn't help but think about the story behind the gun. Alex's grandfather had been a war hero, and the gun had been passed down to him as a symbol of bravery and sacrifice. And now, it had been used to save Alex's life.\n\nI looked down at the gun, still clutched in my hand. It was a strange feeling, holding an object that had just been used to shoot my best friend. But I knew that it had been necessary, and that Alex would understand.\n\nAfter what felt like hours, I heard the sound of helicopters in the distance.",
        "I've always felt like I'm being watched. It's a sensation that's hard to explain, but it's been with me for as long as I can remember.\n\nAs a child, I would catch glimpses of something out of the corner of my eye, only to turn and find no one there.\n\nI tried to brush it off as mere imagination, but the feeling persisted. It was as if I had a constant companion, one that I couldn't see or touch, but could sense nonetheless.\n\nAs I grew older, the feeling never went away. I would be walking down the street, and suddenly I'd feel like I was being followed.\n\nI'd spin around, expecting to see someone lurking behind me, but there would never be anyone there.\n\nDespite the lack of evidence, I knew that I wasn't imagining things. I could feel its presence, a gentle hum in the background of my life.\n\nI never told anyone about it, of course. Who would believe me? They'd think I was crazy, or paranoid, or worse.\n\nSo I kept it to myself, learned to live with the feeling of being watched. It became a part of my daily routine, a constant companion that I grew accustomed to.\n\nBut today was different. Today, I decided that I'd had enough of wondering. I wanted to know what this presence wanted, why it had been following me for so long.\n\nI stood in front of the mirror, looked at my reflection, and said aloud, \"I know you're there. I've always known.\"\n\nThere was no response, of course. But I didn't expect one. I just wanted to acknowledge its presence, to let it know that I was aware.\n\nI took a deep breath, turned around, and walked out of my apartment. I had no idea where I was going, but I knew that I had to take the first step.\n\nAs I walked, I felt the presence around me, a gentle buzzing in the air. It was always there, but today it felt different, more pronounced.\n\nI walked for blocks, trying to clear my head, trying to figure out what I was doing. Was I really trying to communicate with something that might not even exist?\n\nThe sun was setting, casting long shadows across the sidewalk. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized that I was completely alone.\n\nOr was I? I glanced around, half-expecting to see someone lurking in the shadows. But there was no one.\n\nAnd yet, I knew that I wasn't alone. The presence was still with me, watching me, waiting for me to make my next move.",
        "The first ships appeared on a Tuesday morning, massive crystalline structures that hummed with otherworldly energy. Humanity stood in collective awe, watching their descent through Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe Zyx'tal, as they called themselves, assumed their superior technology would guarantee swift victory. They had conquered seventeen worlds before ours, each falling within days of first contact.\n\nWhat they didn't account for was humanity's unique r\u00e9sum\u00e9: ten thousand years of nearly continuous warfare, countless battles fought across every imaginable terrain.\n\nWhen the aliens launched their initial assault on New York, they were met not by panic, but by battle-hardened veterans from a dozen Earth nations, who instinctively understood urban combat in ways the invaders never could.\n\nIn the jungles of Vietnam, local guerrilla tactics that had frustrated superpowers for generations proved equally effective against alien infantry.\n\nThe deserts of the Middle East became graveyards for alien vehicles, as centuries-old insurgency techniques found new targets.\n\nNaval commanders who had studied centuries of maritime warfare adapted their strategies seamlessly to three-dimensional space combat.\n\nThe Zyx'tal's confusion turned to horror as they realized every human child knew more about warfare than their most experienced generals.\n\nEach human nation contributed its martial expertise: Russian winter warfare, Israeli urban combat, Swiss mountain operations, and countless others.\n\nThe aliens had expected a primitive species; instead, they found professors of violence, graduates of an endless war college called Earth.",
        "In the quiet darkness of his bedroom, Alex drifted into a deep slumber. As he fell into the realm of dreams, a familiar sensation washed over him. He was standing in a vast, empty space, with nothing but his own thoughts echoing around him. Suddenly, a figure materialized before him - his future self. The older version of Alex smirked, a sardonic glint in his eyes. \"Well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex seeking advice again,\" he sneered.\n\nIgnoring the condescending tone, Alex straightened his posture. \"I need your help,\" he said, determined. \"I want to know how I can improve my life, make better decisions, be successful.\" His future self chuckled darkly, crossing his arms over his chest. \"Oh, so you finally realize that you need my wisdom, huh?\" he taunted. \"Fine, I'll humor you. But don't expect any sugar-coated advice from me.\"\n\nAlex steeled himself for whatever harsh truths his future self might reveal. \"Tell me, what should I do differently?\" he pressed. The older Alex leaned in, his eyes boring into his younger counterpart. \"First things first, stop being such a pushover,\" he began bluntly. \"You need to toughen up, stop caring so much about what others think, and start putting yourself first.\" Alex felt a pang of discomfort at the words, but he knew there was truth in them.\n\nAs their conversation continued, the future Alex didn't hold back. He criticized Alex's work ethic, his relationships, his self-doubt. Each word felt like a slap to the face, yet Alex listened intently, determined to learn from his mistakes. \"You have potential, kid,\" his future self admitted grudgingly. \"But you're holding yourself back with your fear and insecurity. Take risks, make bold choices, and maybe, just maybe, you'll amount to something.\"\n\nDespite the harshness of his future self's words, Alex couldn't deny the impact they had on him.",
        "Brenda, a self-proclaimed \"poetry whisperer,\" approached the open mic, clutching a crumpled napkin like a sacred text.  Her introduction involved a dramatic sigh and the declaration that her poem, \"Ode to a Toenail,\" was \"birthed from the depths of her soul.\"  The audience shifted uncomfortably.\n\nThe poem itself was a rhyming monstrosity, comparing a toenail's growth to the epic journey of a dandelion seed.  Metaphors collided like bumper cars.  She described the toenail's glistening surface as \"a beacon of hope in a world of despair,\" punctuated by a dramatic sniffle.  A man in the front row choked on his lukewarm coffee.\n\nAs Brenda reached the poem's climax \u2013 the tragic clipping of the toenail \u2013 she emitted a wail that could curdle milk. Tears streamed down her face, mingling with her overly-enthusiastic application of glitter eyeshadow.

        "Go.\n\nShe runs. The bird soars. Four cats play together. The old man walks slowly home. Sarah watched the sunset paint the horizon. The lonely traveler wandered through dense mountain forests. Deep beneath the ancient ruins, mysterious shadows danced eerily. Through winding corridors and crumbling archways, whispers echoed from nowhere. The weathered stone walls seemed to pulse with an otherworldly ancient energy.\n\nAmidst the swirling dust and fragments of forgotten memories, time stood perfectly still. In the heart of this labyrinthine structure, where darkness and light intertwined mysteriously, something stirred. The persistent explorer pressed forward through the oppressive darkness, her torch flickering dangerously ahead.

        "In the bustling halls of St. Ellsworth University, a new and intriguing course had just been introduced: Quantum Gastronomy. The class was a fusion of quantum physics and culinary arts, taught by Professor Lillian Drake, a brilliant mind with a passion for both science and cooking. Students from diverse backgrounds eagerly enrolled, drawn by the promise of exploring the unexpected connections between the microscopic world of particles and the delectable realm of flavors.\n\nOn the first day of the semester, the classroom buzzed with excitement as Professor Drake unveiled her innovative syllabus. She explained how Quantum Gastronomy aimed to revolutionize the way people viewed food and cooking by applying the principles of quantum mechanics to culinary techniques. The students were intrigued by the prospect of delving into the mysteries of subatomic particles while preparing mouthwatering dishes.\n\nThroughout the semester, the students immersed themselves in a series of mind-bending experiments and tastings. They learned about the concept of superposition while creating dishes that balanced contrasting flavors in perfect harmony, much like the delicate dance of particles in a quantum state. They explored the idea of entanglement by studying how the ingredients in a recipe interacted with each other on a molecular level to produce unexpected taste sensations.\n\nOne of the most memorable classes involved a hands-on experiment where the students used molecular gastronomy techniques to transform ordinary ingredients into culinary masterpieces. By manipulating the textures and structures of food at the molecular level, they discovered how seemingly unrelated elements could come together to create a symphony of flavors and textures that defied traditional cooking conventions.\n\nAs the semester progressed, the students began to see the world of food through a new lens, viewing ingredients not just as objects to be combined but as dynamic systems with their own quantum properties. They marveled at the intricate patterns that emerged when different cooking methods were applied to the same set of ingredients, reflecting the unpredictable nature of quantum interactions.\n\nIn the final weeks of the course, the students were tasked with creating their own quantum-inspired dish to showcase their newfound understanding of the relationship between science and gastronomy. The resulting creations were a testament to their creativity and ingenuity, blending scientific concepts with culinary artistry in a way that captivated the palate and the mind.",

        "The forest was silent, a stark contrast to the chaos that had erupted here just days ago. The wind whispered through the leaves, carrying the faint scent of smoke and earth. I trudged through the underbrush, my boots crunching on the debris-strewn ground. The disaster site was a grim tableau, a testament to nature's unpredictable fury.\n\nI was part of a search and rescue team, dispatched to this remote area after a violent storm had caused a massive landslide. The earth had shifted, swallowing homes, vehicles, and lives. My job was to comb through the wreckage, looking for survivors or, more often, remains. It was a grim task, but someone had to do it.\n\nThe team had been out for hours, the sky growing darker with each passing minute. My colleagues had fanned out, their radios crackling with static and occasional updates. I had taken a different path, one that led me deeper into the forest, where the trees grew thick and the shadows long. My compass pointed me in a direction that seemed oddly familiar, though I couldn't quite place why.\n\nAs I moved through the dense foliage, my mind wandered to the people I was searching for. Families torn apart, lives lost in an instant. I wondered if they had known what was coming, if they had had any time to say goodbye. The thought was heavy, a weight that pressed down on my chest.\n\nI paused, wiping sweat from my brow. The air was thick with the smell of decay, a reminder of the grim reality of my task. I took a deep breath, steeling myself for what I might find. As I continued, the path began to clear, leading me to a small clearing where the trees had been uprooted and tossed aside like toys.\n\nIn the center of the clearing, something caught my eye. It was partially obscured by fallen branches and debris, but I could see enough to recognize it. My heart skipped a beat, and a cold sweat broke out on my skin. I approached slowly, my movements mechanical, as if I were in a dream.\n\nThe figure lay on its back, one arm stretched out, the other curled protectively over its chest. The face was serene, almost peaceful, as if in sleep. But the eyes were closed, and there was no rise and fall of the chest. I knelt beside the body, my hands trembling as I reached out to touch it.\n\nIt was me. My own corpse, lying there in the clearing. I felt a surge of panic, my mind reeling. How could this be? I was alive, standing here, breathing, thinking. Yet, there was no mistaking the face, the build, the clothes. It was me, or rather, it was what I would look like if I were dead.\n\nI stumbled back, my mind racing. Was this some kind of hallucination? A trick of the mind? I pinched myself, hard, but the pain only confirmed that I was indeed awake. I looked around, half expecting to see someone else, some explanation for this bizarre turn of events. But there was no one, only the silent forest and the eerie calm of the clearing.\n\nI tried to think logically, to find a rational explanation. Perhaps someone had stolen my identity, or there had been a mix-up with the remains.",
        "In a small, bustling town nestled at the foot of towering mountains, lived a young man named Jack. He ran a quaint little record shop on the main street, where vinyls from every era lined the shelves. The walls were adorned with posters of legendary musicians, and the air was always filled with melodic tunes.\n\nJack had always been drawn to music; it was his escape, his solace. Each day as he swept the floor or arranged new arrivals, he hummed along to whatever track played softly in the background. His favorite song \u2014 an old classic by a band called The Undertones \u2014 echoed through his mind more often than any other.\n\nOne particularly rainy afternoon, a woman walked into his shop with an umbrella that left puddles on the polished wooden floors. She had long brown hair tied up in a messy bun and wore glasses that just barely held together. Her name was Emily.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Jack greeted her with a warm smile as she browsed through the jazz section. \u201cWelcome! What brings you here today?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve moved back to town after being away for years,\u201d Emily replied without looking up from an album cover she scrutinized closely. \u201cI used to love coming here... It feels like home.\u201d\n\nAs days turned into weeks, Emily became a regular customer at Jack\u2019s shop. They talked about everything under the sun\u2014movies they loved, books they found compelling\u2014and inevitably their conversations circled back to music.\n\nOne evening after closing time, while sipping coffee outside under twinkling fairy lights strung across awnings for decoration purposes only (it didn\u2019t rain anymore), Jack shared something personal for once.\u201cYou know what my favorite song is?\u201d He asked suddenly.\n\nEmily shook her head no but leaned forward intrigued nonetheless.\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Teenage Kicks\u2019 by The Undertones.\u201d There was this wistful tone creeping into his voice now.\u201cJust thinking about it makes me feel alive again.\u201d\n\nHer eyes lit up curiously then she asked:\u201cWhy don't we see if I can guess which part of 'Teenage Kicks' resonates most deeply within you?\"\n\nHe laughed lightly before responding seriously: \"Alright then!

        "The sky ripped open, its serenity shattered by an unseen force. A jagged line of light burst forth, and from its gaping wound, something fell.\n\nIt tumbled through the air with a grace that defied its descent, pages fluttering wildly as if trying to take flight. A book, bound in worn leather, landed softly at the feet of a curious young girl.\n\nHer name was Elara, and she was no stranger to oddities. The village elders often whispered about her, claiming she had a touch of magic. She knelt, fingertips grazing the book's cover, warmth emanating from it.\n\nElara glanced skyward, but the rift had sealed, leaving only clouds as witnesses. She hesitated, then opened the tome. The pages turned themselves, an invisible hand guiding them.\n\nWords shimmered into existence, written in a language she somehow understood. They spoke of lands beyond stars and tales of long-lost worlds. As she read, the air around her crackled with energy.\n\nUnbeknownst to Elara, her village was stirring. People gathered at their windows, drawn by the celestial spectacle. They watched, entranced, as the earth beneath her feet began to pulse.\n\nThe book had chosen its keeper. It whispered secrets, each revelation a step further into an adventure she couldn't yet fathom. Her heart raced with anticipation.\n\nA gentle hum enveloped Elara, a melody woven from the song of the universe. Her eyes shone with a light not her own.",
        "In the bustling metropolis of New York City, a series of perplexing events had caught the attention of the Big Apple's sharpest detective \u2013 an enigma unlike any other. It all began with multiple reports from religious scholars around the world claiming that God had forsaken his post in Heaven. Their visions and dreams suggested that the Almighty had left his celestial abode to wander the Earth among humanity, with his temporary sanctuary located in the heart of New York City.\n\nAs the city buzzed with speculation and curiosity, the detective found himself faced with the most daunting case of his career \u2013 tracking down none other than Mr. Almighty himself. Determined and resolute, he embarked on a quest to unravel the truth behind these mystical occurrences, armed only with his sharp mind and unyielding determination. The detective knew that this investigation would challenge everything he thought he knew about the world.\n\nThe streets of New York City became a canvas of wonder and mystery as the detective delved deeper into his investigation. He questioned religious leaders, consulted scholars, and even sought counsel from those who claimed to have encountered the divine presence in the city. Each lead led him down a path of uncertainty and awe, as if the very fabric of reality was shifting beneath his feet.\n\nAmidst the chaos and uncertainty, the detective could sense a palpable shift in the city's energy \u2013 a subtle undercurrent of something extraordinary at play. He found himself drawn to the iconic landmarks and bustling neighborhoods of New York, each corner holding a glimmer of hope and revelation.\n\nIn his pursuit of the elusive Almighty, the detective uncovered narratives of compassion, miracles, and redemption unfolding in the most unexpected of places. It seemed that the presence of God had ignited a flame of introspection and unity among the diverse inhabitants of the city, transcending barriers of faith and belief.\n\nWith each passing day, the detective's resolve grew stronger as he pieced together the fragments of this extraordinary puzzle. His interactions with the city's denizens, from the humblest to the most exalted, revealed a tapestry of human emotion and spirituality unlike anything he had ever witnessed.",
        "In the sprawling cosmos, there were countless species, each with their own unique customs and aphorisms. One such adage, whispered in the dimly lit corridors of interstellar spaceships and around flickering bonfires on distant planets, was about humanity: \"Never push the pink-skins to the thin ice.\" It was a warning that had been passed down through generations, a testament to the unpredictable nature of humans when cornered or provoked. The story of Captain Elara Myles and her crew aboard the starship *Vanguard* would soon become a cautionary tale that would echo across the galaxy.\n\nElara Myles was not just any captain; she was a woman whose reputation for resilience and resourcefulness preceded her. Born on Earth but raised among the stars, she had seen more than her fair share of cosmic anomalies and hostile encounters. Her crew, a diverse mix of species from across the galaxy, respected her not only for her leadership but also for her unwavering determination. When they received an urgent distress signal from a remote sector known for its treacherous conditions and mysterious phenomena, Elara didn't hesitate to answer it.\n\nThe *Vanguard* docked at an abandoned space station orbiting a frozen planet named Icyon IV. The station's maintenance logs indicated that it had been deserted for decades, yet someone\u2014or something\u2014had recently activated its emergency beacon. As Elara led a team to investigate, they found themselves navigating through corridors coated in frost and illuminated by flickering lights. The air was thick with an eerie silence that seemed to press against their eardrums.\n\nDeep within the station's core, they discovered an alien artifact encased in what appeared to be solid ice. It pulsed with an otherworldly energy that made everyone's skin prickle with unease. Dr. Zephyr Thorne, Elara's chief science officer and a scholar of ancient technologies, examined the artifact closely. His eyes widened as he recognized it as part of a long-lost civilization known for their advanced knowledge of temporal manipulation.\n\nBefore anyone could react further, alarms blared throughout the station as unseen forces began to destabilize its systems. The *Vanguard* detected multiple ships approaching from different directions\u2014ships belonging to rival factions who also sought control over such powerful artifacts. Elara realized they were walking into a trap set by forces far more cunning than they had anticipated.",
        "In the year 151441, humanity teetered on the brink of collapse. The once-thriving planet was now a barren wasteland, devoid of life and sustenance.\n\nThe air was thick with desperation as people scrambled to find their next meal. Food was a luxury few could afford, and those who had it hoarded it fiercely.\n\nIn a small, dingy shack, a group of survivors huddled together, sharing what little they had. A meager portion of stale bread and dried vegetables was all they could muster.\n\nBut amidst the despair, there was one thing that brought them together: the last bottle of maple syrup. It had been passed down through generations, a symbol of better times and sweeter memories.\n\nHowever, as they gathered around the table to savor the precious liquid, they noticed something that made their hearts sink. The expiration date on the bottle read \"151440\" - it had expired just one year ago.\n\nThe group fell silent, unsure of what to do next. Some argued that it was still safe to consume, while others warned of the dangers of eating spoiled food.\n\nAs they debated, a young girl named Ava spoke up. She had grown up listening to stories of her ancestors' struggles and triumphs, and she knew that this moment was crucial.\n\nAva suggested that they use the maple syrup as a bargaining chip to trade with other communities for food and supplies. It might be expired, but it still held sentimental value and could be used as a symbol of hope.\n\nThe group agreed to Ava's plan, and set out on a perilous journey across the desolate landscape. They traveled for days, facing countless challenges and setbacks along the way.\n\nAs they walked, they stumbled upon an old advertisement etched into the side of a building: \"Maple Syrup: The Taste of Happiness\". It seemed like a cruel joke now, but Ava saw an opportunity - maybe this relic from the past could be used to revive their dying spirits.",

But then I saw it too, a glitch in the fabric of our supposed reality, a moment when the sky flickered like a faulty television screen, and suddenly their ravings crystallized into perfect clarity. The \"crazy\" ones weren't broken; they were the ones who could see the cracks in our simulated world, who had glimpsed behind the curtain of what we accepted as normal. The homeless prophet on the corner wasn't speaking in tongues but in the original code of our universe. The mathematician who covered his walls in endless equations wasn't calculating numbers but mapping the patterns of our programmed existence. The artist who painted impossible geometries wasn't lost in delusion but documenting the true shape of space-time. Now I understand why they laugh at our ignorance, why they weep for our blindness, why they desperately try to wake us from this collective dream we call reality.

They had been together for years, sharing their lives and dreams with each other. But now those four simple words seemed to carry the weight of a thousand unspoken fears and doubts.\n\nMark cleared his throat, breaking the heavy silence that had settled in the room. \"I know things haven't been easy lately,\" he began tentatively, reaching out to touch Sarah's hand. She flinched at his touch but didn't pull away.

        "As I walked into the room, I was immediately struck by the sense of reverence that filled the air. A group of people, all dressed in simple white robes, sat cross-legged on the floor, their eyes fixed intently on a small, plain, clear glass marble that rested on a pedestal in the center of the room. They seemed to be in a trance-like state, their faces serene and peaceful, as if they were experiencing some kind of profound spiritual connection. I felt a pang of curiosity and wondered what could possibly be so special about this ordinary-looking marble.\n\nOne of the robed figures noticed my presence and beckoned me to come closer. I hesitated for a moment, feeling a little out of place, but my curiosity got the better of me. As I approached the pedestal, the figure gestured for me to reach out and touch the marble. I did so, expecting to feel nothing out of the ordinary, but as soon as my skin made contact with the glass, I was hit with a sudden rush of emotions and sensations. It was as if the marble had unlocked a deep well of feelings and memories within me, and I felt myself being flooded with visions and experiences that were not my own.\n\nI saw flashes of joy and sorrow, of love and loss, of triumph and defeat. I felt the pain of a mother who had lost her child, the elation of a couple on their wedding day, and the fear of a soldier going into battle. The visions were disjointed and fragmented, but they were incredibly vivid and real, and I felt as though I was living through them all. I realized that the marble was somehow tapping into the collective unconscious, allowing me to access the deepest, most primal emotions and experiences of humanity. It was a truly overwhelming and humbling experience, and I felt my own sense of self expanding and evolving as I touched the marble.\n\nAs I stood there, frozen in wonder, the robed figures began to stir and slowly rise to their feet. They smiled at me, and I saw that they understood exactly what I was going through. They nodded in approval, as if to say, \"Yes, you get it now. You understand why we worship this marble.\" And in that moment, I did understand. The marble was not just a simple object; it was a key to the deepest, most profound aspects of human experience.",

        "I am alone, but I am happy. The vast cavern feels like a cocoon, insulating me from the chaos of the outside world. Its silent walls hum with an ancient secret, echoing the soft rhythm of my breath. I have chosen this solitude, for peace and quiet are rare commodities in a world that never stops to listen.\n\nDays blend into nights here, marked only by the faint changes in light filtering through tiny fissures in the rock.

        "From the moment I took my first steps, the earth whispered secrets to me. My feet, pressing into the ground, felt the layers of history, the weight of forgotten stories. It was a gift, a curse, a connection that set me apart from the world. Archaeologists saw me as a beacon of hope, a living divination rod. But today, as I stood on the edge of a sprawling site in the dense Amazon rainforest, I hesitated. The ground beneath my feet hummed with a different kind of energy, one that sent shivers down my spine.\n\nThe team had gathered around me, their faces a mix of excitement and anticipation. Dr. Elara Myles, the lead archaeologist, her eyes sparkled with the thrill of discovery. \"What do you sense, Lila?\" she asked, her voice tinged with urgency.\n\nI closed my eyes, letting the earth's vibrations wash over me. The usual pulses of ancient artifacts, the faint echoes of long-lost civilizations, were there. But they were overshadowed by something darker, something that seemed to resist being unearthed. \"We should not dig here,\" I said, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\nDr. Myles's smile faltered. \"Why not? What is it?\"\n\nI opened my eyes and met her gaze. \"There's something... wrong. The ground is telling me to stay away.\"\n\nShe frowned, her scientific mind clashing with my intuitive abilities. \"Lila, we've been looking for this site for years. We have the permits, the funding, and the support. We can't just turn back now.\"\n\nI shook my head, trying to convey the depth of my unease. \"It's not about turning back. It's about respecting what lies beneath. There are things buried here that should remain undisturbed.\"\n\nThe team exchanged skeptical glances. They had always trusted my instincts, but this was the first time I had ever advised against digging. Dr. Myles took a deep breath and looked at the others. \"Let's discuss this. We need to weigh all our options.\"\n\nWe moved to a shaded area, where the heat of the midday sun was less oppressive. Dr. Myles laid out the evidence: the satellite images, the soil samples, the historical records. Everything pointed to a significant find, a lost city that could rewrite the history of the region.\n\n\"I understand your reservations, Lila,\" Dr. Myles said. \"But we have a responsibility to uncover the past. Imagine what we could learn, what we could share with the world.\"\n\nI nodded, understanding her perspective. \"I do. But there are some things that shouldn't be disturbed. This place... it feels like a warning. Like the earth itself is trying to protect something.\"\n\nThe team was divided. Some, like Dr. Myles, were eager to proceed. Others, sensing my unease, were more cautious. Dr. Theo Randall, the geologist, spoke up. \"Lila, can you be more specific? What exactly are you sensing?\"\n\nI tried to articulate the indescribable. \"It's hard to explain. It's like... a barrier. A force that resists being penetrated. And there's a presence, an old and powerful presence, that doesn't want to be disturbed.\"\n\nDr. Myles sighed, rubbing her temples. \"We need to make a decision. We can't afford to lose this opportunity.\"\n\nAfter much debate, they decided to start small, to test the waters. They would dig a single test pit, a shallow trench to see what lay just beneath the surface. I watched as they prepared the site, my anxiety growing with each passing moment.\n\nThe first shovel went into the ground, and a wave of unease washed over me. The earth trembled slightly, a subtle response to the intrusion. Dr. Myles called out, \"Keep digging, but be gentle. We don't want to damage anything.\"\n\nAs the trench deepened, the air grew thick with an unexplainable tension. The soil, rich and dark, yielded no immediate treasures. But then, something caught my eye. A glint, a shimmer, almost imperceptible. I leaned closer, and my heart sank.\n\nBeneath the surface, partially buried, was a small, intricately carved stone. It was unlike anything I had ever seen, covered in symbols that seemed to pulse with a life of their own. I reached out, and the moment my fingers touched the stone, a surge of energy coursed through me. Visions flooded my mind: ancient rituals, a civilization bound by powerful magic, a pact with the earth itself.",
        "Once upon a time, in a small town nestled by the whispering pines, there lived a young woman named Elara. Elara was known for her sharp wit and fierce independence, yet she had a tendency to be slightly impulsive with her words.\n\nOne evening, under the glow of the full moon, a charming but persistent suitor named Damien professed his affection for Elara. In a moment of frustration, Elara uttered words she would soon come to regret. \"I'll go on a date with you the day hell freezes over,\" she retorted, her words laced with an unintended sting.\n\nThe next morning, as the first light of dawn filtered through her window, Elara was startled awake by a bone-chilling coldness permeating her room. Rubbing her groggy eyes, she blinked in disbelief at the sight before her. There, standing in the center of her room, was none other than Satan himself, shivering uncontrollably, his dark form streaked with frost and snow.\n\nElara's heart leaped in her chest, a mixture of awe and fear swirling within her. She had always been skeptical of supernatural beings and the existence of Hell, yet the presence of the Devil before her was undeniable. His piercing gaze locked onto hers, and she could see a flicker of vulnerability in his crimson eyes, a vulnerability she never expected to witness in the ruler of the underworld.\n\n\"I've come to collect on your words, Elara,\" Satan's voice was as cold as the winter wind, his words sending a shiver down her spine. \"You said you would go on a date with me the day hell freezes over, and here we are.\"\n\nElara's mind raced with a whirlwind of emotions. This was a situation she never could have imagined, a surreal twist of fate that left her both intrigued and apprehensive. With trembling hands, she gestured for Satan to take a seat, offering him a cup of steaming tea in a feeble attempt to warm his icy form.\n\nAs the minutes ticked by, a strange sense of camaraderie began to form between Elara and the Devil. They exchanged stories of their respective realms, finding unexpected common ground in their shared experiences of being misunderstood and judged by others. Elara saw a different side of Satan, one that was not defined by fear or darkness, but by a poignant sense of loneliness and longing.\n\nAs the day wore on, the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm glow across the room. Satan's icy exterior began to melt away, revealing a figure that was surprisingly human in its vulnerabilities and desires.",
        "In the quiet dawn of a world turned upside down, I found myself standing in the midst of chaos, yet untouched by its fury. The air was thick with the stench of decay and the distant moans of the undead. I had always known that I was different, immortal in a world where everyone else aged and died. But this\u2014this was something I had never anticipated.\n\nThe first time I encountered one of them, I had been out gathering supplies from an abandoned store. The doors were chained shut, but the windows offered easy access. As I rummaged through the aisles, I heard a shuffling sound behind me. I turned to see a man, his skin pale and eyes vacant, reaching out for me. My heart raced, but to my surprise, he stumbled past me as if I wasn't even there. It was then that I realized the zombies didn't see me as a threat or a meal; they simply ignored me.\n\nFor the first few weeks, I wandered aimlessly, trying to understand this new world. Cities lay in ruins, buildings crumbling, and the streets filled with the dead. Yet, amid the desolation, I found a strange sense of peace. I could walk freely, without fear of being attacked. The only challenges I faced were the living who hadn't succumbed to the virus.\n\nI settled into a small, suburban home on the outskirts of what had once been a bustling city. The house was quaint, with a white picket fence and a garden overgrown with weeds. It felt safe, almost normal. I spent my days tending to the garden, fishing in the nearby creek, and exploring the abandoned neighborhood. At night, I read old books I found in the local library, which remained eerily intact.\n\nAs the months turned into years, I adapted to this new lifestyle. I learned to cook using whatever supplies I could scavenge, and I even managed to start a small hydroponic garden in the basement. The house became a sanctuary, a place where time seemed to stand still. But the outside world was never far from my thoughts. The distant sound of gunfire and the occasional scream served as a constant reminder of the chaos that reigned beyond my walls.\n\nOne day, while exploring a nearby town, I stumbled upon a group of survivors huddled in an old supermarket. They were a motley crew\u2014a couple with a young child, a lone man, and an elderly woman. They looked at me with a mixture of suspicion and relief when I approached. \"You're not... one of them,\" the man said, his voice tinged with hope.\n\nI smiled and introduced myself. \"My name is Alex. I've been living alone since this all began. I thought you might need some help.\"\n\nThey accepted my offer, and together we fortified the supermarket. We built barricades, rationed our supplies, and kept a watchful eye for any signs of danger. For the first time in years, I felt a sense of community. The child, a little girl named Lily, especially brought light into my life. She was curious and full of questions, always asking about the world before the apocalypse.\n\nLiving with the group was a stark contrast to my solitary existence. We shared stories and laughter, and the nights were no longer filled with the oppressive silence of solitude. But the sense of safety was fleeting. One night, a horde of zombies breached our defenses. The group fought valiantly, but it was clear that staying in the supermarket was no longer an option.\n\nWe made the difficult decision to move on, hoping to find a safer place. Our journey was treacherous, navigating through cities overrun by the undead.",
        "In a swirling galaxy far beyond the reach of human exploration, an alien being named Xylon embarked on a mission to Earth. His purpose was unique - to rate the intelligence of humans compared to the myriad civilizations he had encountered across a million worlds. With his sleek silver spacecraft descending silently through Earth's atmosphere, Xylon marveled at the planet below, teeming with life and diversity.\n\nAs he touched down in a remote corner of an expansive desert, Xylon emerged from his ship with curiosity sparking in his multifaceted eyes. He observed humans bustling about their daily lives, engaging in various activities that ranged from simple tasks to complex interactions. The alien paused to analyze their behavior, using advanced technology embedded within his slender appendages to gather data on their cognitive abilities.\n\nFrom bustling cities filled with towering skyscrapers to serene countryside villages nestled amidst rolling hills, Xylon traversed diverse landscapes seeking insights into humanity's intellectual prowess. He engaged in conversations with scholars discussing quantum theory and children giggling as they solved puzzles together. Each encounter offered him a glimpse into the vast spectrum of human intelligence \u2013 from profound wisdom born of centuries-old knowledge to creative innovations inspired by youthful imagination.\n\nDespite encountering moments of folly and misunderstanding among certain individuals, Xylon noted with admiration how humans displayed resilience and adaptability in face of challenges that tested their intellects. Their capacity for empathy and cooperation also left a lasting impression on him as he witnessed acts of kindness exchanged between strangers bound by common goals.\n\nBefore departing Earth for his next interstellar destination, Xylon compiled his assessment based on meticulous observations made during his stay. While acknowledging areas where humans still had much room for growth intellectually, he commended them for their insatiable thirst for knowledge and unwavering determination in overcoming obstacles that lay before them on this pale blue dot suspended in the cosmic expanse."
